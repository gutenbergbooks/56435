<p>Four years passed rapidly and tranquilly at
Fairlee. The waters of Lochleven flowed at the
foot of its undulating grounds, and the mountains
of Glencoe terminated the grandly-beautiful
and distant prospect which Christobelle
gazed upon with untired delight, from the
different points where she loved to sit in meditation,
or employed herself in painting its
glowing and ever-changing tints. Often did
the forms of Anna Maria and Isabel appear before
her, as she lingered upon the mountain-tops
which overhung the lake, and watched the golden
sun sink below the horizon.</p>

<p>Often did the woods and smiling lands of Wetheral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
appear to her mental view; and though
its scenery, so flatly tame, sank into insignificance
before the cloud-capped Cona, and the hills
of many names which surrounded the rich and
beautiful Lochleven&mdash;still, <i>there</i> was the remembrance
of her first attachments; there were the
forms she loved, and the hearts which loved her,
fondly. There was the scene of her infancy, and
there she had parted from her kind companion
and friend, Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>Anna Maria's heart and eyes were given exclusively
to her excellent husband, and Isabel
was devoted to her child; but Sir John Spottiswoode
had been for weeks her instructor, her
only attendant, and the depository of her
thoughts. She felt the loss of his society for
months; and when she gazed upon the calm
lake, or mused upon the rocky heights, each and
all threw back her thoughts to Sir John Spottiswoode.
Oh! what would he, the travelled one,
the lover of grand scenery&mdash;what would <i>he</i> say
to the bold and graceful scenery? What would
he say to the combination of wood, and rock, and
pleasant glens; the mountains, the water, and all
the glorious views which decorated Lochleven?
Surely he would love its repose, its agitations, its
sublimity; surely he would love its groves, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
islands, and its storms. He would roam with
her through the lovely glens; they would together
visit the falls of Kinlochmore: they
would meditate together on Eilan na Corak, and
climb the highest points to watch the setting
sun, and think upon absent ones. Why had she
not a brother to accompany her in her pleasant
rambles, and why was he not Sir John Spottiswoode?</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's health did not recover the
shock of Lady Kerrison's death. She sank gradually
into an invalid: and, though she rarely
visited the beauteous scenes around her, and
never admired their grandeur, yet her thoughts
rested no longer upon England. She was content
to remain at Fairlee, exhausted in body,
and depressed in mind. Her temper lost every
trace of its former playfulness, and she dwelt
constantly and bitterly upon the idea of Clara's
ingratitude in not seeing her at the time of her
decease. She told Christobelle the voice of
Clara came to her in the dead of the night, and
thundered in the wind which roared from the
mountains. She saw Clara in her dreams ever
pointing towards her, and exclaiming, "Oh!
hard-hearted mother!" She declared to Christobelle
that if her death should prove the consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of such distressing visitations, she died
by the hand of Lady Kerrison, and her ungrateful
conduct would have been the means of
destroying the author of her existence, and the
contriver of her high and enviable establishment.
She had indeed heard of ungrateful children;
but little could she imagine she was herself
to fall a victim to the daughters whom she
had reared so carefully. Clara had died, and
she expected Julia would be equally undutiful.
Not once had she been invited to Bedinfield,
nor was she even apprized of their flight
abroad!</p>

<p>Such were Lady Wetheral's feelings; and her
irritable and disappointed mind vented its bitterness
upon the innocent Christobelle. The
leading thought of her heart and the aim of her
actions had ever been the establishment of her
children, and upon her youngest daughter, now
in the midst of suffering and solitude, did her
anxiety rest. Christobelle was to beware of the
sun and of the dew. It was ruinous to the complexion
to sit staring for hours in a hot sun upon
nonsensical views, and still worse, to roam about
with a plaid round her shoulders, and a hat
swinging to her arm, like a low-lived Scotch girl.
Lochleven produced much gaiety in the autumn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as many families thronged to visit lake scenery;
she would therefore feel obliged by Miss Chrystal
paying a little more attention to her person, that
she might not be recognized as Lady Wetheral's
very vulgar daughter, or give occasion of remark
to General Ponsonby's family. General Ponsonby,
as a man of high connections, might probably
have people staying at Clanmoray of some
consideration; and she insisted upon her careful
attention to dress and manners. She might
meet gentlemen unexpectedly, and a young lady
should be upon her guard. No man could be
struck with a girl whose tanned complexion gave
her the appearance of having tended sheep and
goats upon the hill-tops.</p>

<p>In spite of Lady Wetheral's precautions, Christobelle
met no gentleman "unexpectedly," nor
were her studies interrupted by any people of
consideration from Clanmoray. Letters from
England told of Mrs. Tom Pynsent's increasing
family; and Isabel's visit was deferred, year after
year, by the expected death of Miss Tabitha,
whose illness had proved long and suffering. She
could not bear to hear or think of her brother's
departure from Shropshire while she still lingered,
and Mr. Boscawen had promised to close her
eyes ere he quitted Brierly. Isabel's visit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
therefore, must remain uncertain: she was the
mother of three children, and her anxiety was
very great to exhibit them all at Fairlee, and
listen to the roar of the cataracts with Christobelle.</p>

<p>There was also news of Julia. The party had
returned to Bedinfield, and Colonel Neville was
still in the suite of the Countess-dowager; but
few ever penetrated into the mysteries of Bedinfield.
The Ennismores saw little company, and
it was reported the establishment consisted
chiefly of foreigners selected by the Countess
mother. Colonel Neville remained desperately
attached to Julia, and Lord Ennismore rarely
quitted his apartments; his lordship was becoming
extremely invalided, and Dr. Anstruther
was superseded by a Florence physician.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent wrote frequently to Christobelle,
and from her chatty pen, Miss Wetheral received
the home news of the south. "Every one,"
she wrote, "was pretty well except 'Bobby,'
who looked very like a turkey with the pip, for
his head was sinking between his shoulders, and
his poor back got round. However, he played
with the eldest boy, and left every thing to Tom,
who&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;grew handsomer every
day, and rattled over business much better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
his poor moonshine father. Sally Hancock sat
with him now and then, and her company was
getting rather amusing to him: altogether, they
were tolerably well at Hatton. Sophy Spottiswoode
was married, and they talked of visiting
Scotland with Sir John Spottiswoode; perhaps
they would visit Lochleven and Fairlee, and see
what was acting there and thereabouts. Sir
Jacky seemed to wish to peep about Lochleven,
for reasons best known to himself." Mrs. Pynsent
ended by hoping Christobelle was not
obliged to be in love with some red-headed
Scotchman, because he was rich.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral twice visited Shropshire
during his seclusion at Fairlee, but his daughter
could not accompany him. Lady Wetheral's
health detained her; and, during his absence,
the magnificence of the country, its quiet grandeur,
and its beautiful variety, could not recompense
her for the misery she endured under continual
and unabated reproaches, or the language
of useless complaint, unceasingly uttered in doleful
tones. Her ladyship considered her daughter's
singlehood at seventeen years of age a
severe blow upon her matronly cares. Up to
the moment of her seventeenth birthday, Christobelle
had never received an offer of marriage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or heard a comment upon her beauty, save in the
somewhat coarse approbation which was bestowed
by Mrs. Pynsent upon her growth at
Hatton.</p>

<p>Christobelle had never listened to adulation,
nor had she ever, in her walks, met a look or observation
which could be construed into admiration,
or even commendation. She bounded in
health and freedom of heart over the mountains,
and sailed on the lake with her attendant Janet,
without a thought of care, or a wish to shine as
her sisters had done, before her entrance into
society. She wished her father alone to share in
her rambles; if her fancy ever strayed beyond his
presence, it was in a sigh to think how greatly
she should enjoy the surprise and pleasure which
Sir John Spottiswoode must feel, if he ever beheld
the scenery of Lochleven. But it was not
so with Lady Wetheral.</p>

<p>Every year brought newly-awakened annoyance
to Christobelle, in the ironical tone of her
mother's birthday congratulation: and it brought
equal affliction to her ladyship, that she must
still endure the society of a daughter unsought,
and very probably destined to remain single.
Her father was in England when she received
congratulations upon attaining her seventeenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
year. Sir John promised to reach Fairlee, if
possible, in time to spend that day with his
daughter at the falls of Kinlochmore; but it was
not to be so, and she entered the breakfast-room
that morning depressed and without appetite.
Lady Wetheral commenced her attack.</p>

<p>"I believe, Bell, you are now seventeen. I
beg to offer my congratulations upon the effect
you have created at Lochleven. Clara and Isabel
were married at your age, and I am expecting
every day to be consulted upon some affair of
your own. You appear to have made no impression
upon young Ponsonby, after all your
walks and sails upon the water."</p>

<p>"Young Ponsonby, mamma!"</p>

<p>"Some people never care to understand what
they do not wish to know," replied her mother.
"In the precincts of Lochleven your want of
power to please may pass unobserved, but I
should have been pointed at in England, as a
mother hopeless of her daughter's establishment."</p>

<p>"But young Ponsonby never walks and sails
with <i>me</i>, mamma. I am only accompanied by
Janet."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly aware that Janet is your only
companion," replied her mother, drily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never wished to be with Mr. Ponsonby,
mamma. I declined Miss Ponsonby's invitation
to join her party at Ballahuish."</p>

<p>"You did very unwisely. I wish you to join
the Ponsonby parties. Have I not told you repeatedly
that wish?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would be alone, mamma."</p>

<p>"I should be much obliged by your thinking
to more purpose, Bell. I never wish to interfere
with your engagements, when they tend to a
proper end."</p>

<p>"But what end could be answered at Ballahuish,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"You are growing extremely disagreeable and
argumentative, Miss Wetheral. I will trouble
you to withhold your rather imperious questionings,
if you please."</p>

<p>Christobelle was silent, and Lady Wetheral
proceeded with her breakfast; but nothing met
her approbation. The coffee was cold, the eggs
were not fresh, and the rolls were burnt. Every
thing was most uncomfortable since she had
quitted England&mdash;particularly uncomfortable,
since no one was near her to make her wants a
matter of the least consideration.</p>

<p>Christobelle offered to ring for hot coffee.</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged by your remaining where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
you are, if you please. Ingratitude is nothing
new to me: Clara taught me <i>that</i> parental
misery&mdash;I can bear it now with patience. Clara
has ruined my health by her ungrateful conduct.
I, who sought her advancement in life, and who
almost made the offer to establish her at Ripley,
deserved a better fate than to be spurned from
her dying bed, and see Mrs. Pynsent preferred
before me. I cannot understand a coarse personage
like Mrs. Pynsent being a proper attendant
upon a deathbed. Her loud voice would
disturb the dead."</p>

<p>"But she was so gentle and kind to Clara!
She was so attentive, papa said!"</p>

<p>"I shall never believe it."</p>

<p>"But you remember how very kindly she assisted
me, and how tenderly she nursed you,
mamma."</p>

<p>"I was not on my deathbed. Close that
window, Bell, the wind is rising; and do shut
out the sound of those French horns."</p>

<p>Christobelle rose to obey. Two small vessels
were traversing the loch, containing a party of
pleasure, apparently intending to pass the morning
in the island which was once the prison-house
of Mary. A band of French horns woke the
echoes as they rowed along, and the air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
"Auld lang syne," delightfully played in parts,
riveted her attention. For a few moments she
paused to listen, but the sounds affected Lady
Wetheral beyond endurance: she trembled and
wept. Christobelle closed the window.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear those sounds," she cried,
clasping her hands. "I hear Clara's voice, and
she persists in calling me her hard-hearted mother.
Her voice is in every sound, and that tone
kills me. I am not hard-hearted&mdash;I am an injured
mother, worn down by that ungrateful
voice. I hear it in the winds at night, and the
breeze of the lake whispers it. I cannot bear to
hear Clara's voice."</p>

<p>Christobelle endeavoured to calm her mother's
nerves, but repeated attacks had destroyed their
tone, and she could not rally at pleasure. Mrs.
Bevan was summoned to attend her lady, and
she was laid upon her bed to receive the usual
remedies. Her ladyship was then left in quiet
and in darkness for some hours. This scene was
but the recurrence of a now constantly repeated attack
of the nerves upon every sound which reached
her ear from without. The storm, the breeze,
the sighing of the winds, the soft and delicious
music which occasionally rose on the air, all
created the same terror&mdash;it was Clara reproaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
her for youth and happiness blasted, and
constantly exclaiming, "Oh, hard-hearted mother!"</p>

<p>Time increased the disorder. Four years' residence
in Scotland, far from the scene of Clara's
tragic departure, and removed beyond all allusion
to the events which had occurred, did not
soften by distance the regrets of Lady Wetheral's
heart. Year after year brought increased
nervousness; and Sir John had endeavoured
to lead his lady's thoughts again towards
Wetheral, but in vain. "She had resolved
never again to visit a country which had brought
her so much disquietude. Clara was gone&mdash;gone
from her for ever, tainted with bitter ingratitude,
and the grandeur of Lady Ennismore's establishment
was to her a blank&mdash;she had never witnessed
it. All that she had most anxiously
desired had become a source of misery to her
feelings, and she only desired now to live far
away from painful associations." Sir John
pointed out the near neighbourhood of her two
happily-married daughters, Pynsent and Boscawen;
but it failed to create pleasing thoughts.</p>

<p>"No, I have no wish to see those objects
which will remind me of Julia's banishment and
Clara's death. If they are happy, why was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Julia to be with me, and why was Clara ungrateful?
Why was <i>I</i> to be defeated in my
views? Why was Julia carried abroad without
one interview with the mother who endured so
much to secure her establishment, without even
writing to me? No; I am miserable, but let
me alone, and let me die here!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral would at such moments turn
to Miss Wetheral with looks of reproach, and
inveigh against her unattractive appearance or
manner.</p>

<p>"If you wished to give me pleasure, Bell, you
would not fly in my face, as Clara did. If you
attended to your person, I might yet be gratified
by hearing praises of your beauty, and receive
pleasure in contemplating your future
establishment; but I have no hopes for you. I
have no inducement to quit this dreary Lochleven.
I will not carry forth a daughter who is blind to
her own advancement, or subject myself to ridicule,
by the constant appendage of a young
woman who is likely to pass single to her grave.
If I could rouse you to exertion, I might rally
too; but this determined indifference to future
distinction destroys me. I am doomed to suffer
every gradation of parental disappointment."</p>

<p>What hand could pluck from her ladyship's memory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"this rooted sorrow?" What hand could
cleanse her bosom of this "perilous stuff?" Haman
knew no peace while Mordecai sat at the king's
gate, and Lady Wetheral would not be comforted,
because the eye of admiration had not yet
glanced upon Christobelle, or opened a channel
for her energies to rise again under the exciting
employment of speculating upon her future establishment.
What a life was this! After Lady
Wetheral's departure to her room, under the
nervous effect produced by the lake music, Christobelle
strolled along its banks, accompanied by
Janet. The little band still poured their sounds
upon the breeze, as they sat listening to the
sprightly notes of "Will ye gang to the bourne,
my Marion:" and at its conclusion Christobelle's
eager fancy suggested the idea of sailing towards
the Isle, to enjoy the softly-swelling sounds which
now but faintly stole upon the ear. The boatmen
were quickly summoned to their oars, and Christobelle
ordered them to stretch and lie to, under
the Isle, where the party were seated beneath
the trees, which once afforded shade to the royal
Mary in her captivity.</p>

<p>A boat put out from the land as they approached,
and Christobelle saw the figures of
Miss Ponsonby and her brother Charles seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in its stern. Miss Ponsonby waved her hand as
the boat glided to her side, and hailed her "prisoner."
A large party from Clanmoray were
regaling in the "Douglas Isle," and her movements
had been watched through many telescopes.
Miss Wetheral had declined her party
to Ballahuish; but her captivity was now as
sure as that of the unfortunate Queen of Scots,
unless a Douglas again rose to the rescue.</p>

<p>"It was a party," Miss Ponsonby said, "in
honour of her eldest brother, who had left Ireland
on a long furlough, and who had arrived at Clanmoray,
after an absence of six years. She
would allow no excuses to prevail. Miss Wetheral
must and should do honour also to Edward's
arrival." Christobelle was loth to obey
the mandate: she was quite unprepared for the
little incident, and felt alarmed at the idea of
encountering a large company almost unknown
to her. Miss Ponsonby, however, ordered the
boats towards the landing-place, and the party
disembarked. The Ponsonby family came forward
to welcome Miss Wetheral's arrival, and
they introduced her to the assembled group.</p>

<p>The Duke of Forfar, lately raised to the dukedom
by the death of his aged father, was present;
and there was also young Lord Farnborough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
once the Selgrave, whose name she
trembled to hear from her mother's lips, when
she spoke of him as a future suitor. Christobelle
saw also Lady Anna Herbert, the imagined
rival of Mrs. Charles Spottiswoode in her
days of coquetry; and her mind glanced back
to the time when she heard so much and so often
of the Farnborough Stacy family. Lady Anna
Herbert was still unmarried, and she could perceive
the same lively manners, the same coquettish
look, which had so formidably alarmed
the fears of Miss Wycherly.</p>

<p>His Grace politely acknowledged his intimate
acquaintance with her family, and his pleasure
at being able to renew it with a daughter of Sir
John Wetheral upon the distant Lochleven. He
had no remembrance of Miss Wetheral, but
young people sprung up around him into life.
His Grace had heard of a beauteous scion, unseen
at Wetheral Castle, but it was reserved to
him to meet her for the first time, on poetical
and historical ground&mdash;on the very spot where
the beautiful Mary of Scotland landed in misfortune,
a captive beauty, such as the vision
which now met his eye.</p>

<p>"Well done, papa!" cried Lady Anna, "your
imagination is awakened by this scene, and Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Wetheral has fortunately appeared to keep up
the illusion. Miss Wetheral, you should reply in
character, and papa will be charmed."</p>

<p>"If Miss Wetheral will personate the afflicted
queen," said Lord Farnborough, "I must beg
to enact the faithful Douglas, and aid her
escape."</p>

<p>"Very good, let it be so," replied his Grace
of Forfar: "this is the very spot to renew our
recollections. Who will be the warder, Lady
Douglas?"</p>

<p>"If I can in any way represent the character,
I shall be happy to look the grim gaoler," answered
Lady Anna Herbert.</p>

<p>Christobelle stood confused and blushing, amid
the group of strangers who gathered round her.
Among the gaily-apparelled females, she alone
appeared rudely clad in the costume of the
country; she alone wore the plaid and bonnet
which decorated the humble inhabitants of Kinross,
and the hamlets around Lochleven. She
felt for the moment distressed at her appearance,
so distinct from the party with whom she was
destined to mix. Her confusion was apparent
to the polite Miss Ponsonby. She took her
hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral is all good-nature to obey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
my bidding, and we are happy in having <i>one</i>
of our number, at least, attired in proper costume.
Lady Anna, how came we to plan our
day's amusement, and yet forget the most material
subject of dress?"</p>

<p>"You have ruined the effect of our <i>tout-ensemble</i>
by your sudden appearance, Miss Wetheral,"
observed Lord Farnborough; "we
thought ourselves unique, and you only exhibit
our deficiencies. You are often here, I presume."</p>

<p>"It has been a favourite spot of mine these
four years," replied Christobelle, slightly confused.</p>

<p>"You are then the genius of the place, Miss
Wetheral. Will you point out to me the favourite
haunts of your long seclusion, and do the
honours of Lochleven to a stranger?"</p>

<p>Christobelle was very willing to be the stranger's
guide; and she found herself shortly after
her arrival in "the Douglas Isle," seated between
Miss Ponsonby and Lord Farnborough, pointing
out the beauties of the lake scenery. Miss Ponsonby
smiled at her enthusiastic descriptions.</p>

<p>"After this specimen of your powers, Miss
Wetheral, do not hope to escape me in future.
You would have graced our quiet bivouac at
Ballahuish. No one spoke a word, or commented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
upon the luxuriant lake, there. No one
possessed your happy taste for the romantic; or
they kept it all to themselves at Ballahuish.
To be sure, Lord Farnborough was not with us."</p>

<p>"Are you so fond of scenery, my lord?"
asked Christobelle, turning towards her other
companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, his lordship is a poet and a painter,"
replied Miss Ponsonby; "he must, therefore,
necessarily love the stupendous and the beautiful,
such as now lies before us. His lordship
muses at the view of Ossian's 'Cona,' and
writes verses upon Ballahuish ferry."</p>

<p>"Miss Ponsonby is pleased to be merry at my
expense," said Lord Farnborough; "nevertheless,
I worship Nature's beautiful productions."</p>

<p>"Then you must visit the falls of Kinlochmore,
my lord; and if you are poetical, muse
over those mountain-tops, and visit the little ruin
of St. Mungo's Isle, to hear the breeze murmur
of the clans of Glencoe and Lochaber."</p>

<p>"Will you, the presiding spirit, attend me
there?" asked Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>"We will <i>all</i> attend you," cried Miss Ponsonby.
"The more spirits the better, my lord,
upon such a mission. Miss Wetheral, you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
promise to attend my summons to St. Mungo's
Isle."</p>

<p>"If I can quit Fairlee for a whole day, I shall
be happy to attend you."</p>

<p>"But mind, Miss Wetheral, I insist upon
your costume; you look now like the ghost of
Scotland flitting among the barbarians who have
ravaged her soil, and changed her customs."</p>

<p>Christobelle continued some time in the island
with Miss Ponsonby and Lord Farnborough, as
the party formed in little groups under the trees,
to gaze upon the calm lake and its beautiful
shores, and they wandered round the tower and
its precincts, which once held a queen of Scotland
in durance. Christobelle thought Lord
Farnborough spoke with feeling upon the events
of Lochleven Castle; and she contemplated his
intelligent countenance with an interest remote
from the fear which took possession of her mind,
when her lady mother first urged her intention
that she should marry Lord Selgrave.</p>

<p>They were soon deeply engaged in Scottish
history, following the current of events which
closed the reign and life of Mary; and though
Miss Ponsonby contended that her existence
proved a course of wicked efforts to gain the
English crown, and raise rebellion in her cousin's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dominions, Christobelle defended the beautiful
captive, with all the rhetoric of youthful enthusiasm.
It was, however, time to return to
Fairlee, and Christobelle could no longer linger
with her friends in the Douglas Isle. General
Ponsonby and Lord Farnborough gallantly escorted
her into the little vessel which had
awaited her commands, and where Janet still sat
in expectation of her return. Mr. Ponsonby returned
to the company with his father, as the
boatmen pushed from the shore, but Lord Farnborough
bounded into the vessel, and took his
seat by the side of Christobelle, ere it drove from
its mooring. He meant, he said, to see her land
safely on the grounds of Fairlee, and it was useless
to deny him the pleasure, or, he might say,
the propriety of accompanying her across the
lake.</p>

<p>The vessel at that moment left the shore, and
the little horn band almost instantly played with
great taste, "My heart's in the Highlands."
Christobelle turned her head towards the shore,
and gazed upon the gay groups preparing for an
early meal. Their forms gradually receded
from view, and were lost in the distance; but
the music continued its dying strains, and fell
fainter and fainter upon the breeze. The silence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was unbroken for some time, as they crossed the
slumbering lake; but Lord Farnborough, at
last, broke the stillness of the scene by asking
Christobelle if she amused herself in sketching
the lovely views on either side Lochleven. From
this question, answered in the affirmative, they
entered upon the subject of painting, which
gradually led to its sister art&mdash;poetry; and Christobelle
was delighted to know that when they
visited St. Mungo's Isle, she would judge of his
progress in both departments. They were both
to go provided with drawing materials; and, if
Christobelle insisted upon it, his lordship would
submit a few poetic inspirations to her "better
judgment," upon a rock overhanging the lake,
even before the party took place.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that their acquaintance
would end here, after the pleasures of the
morning. His lordship entreated permission to
wait upon Miss Wetheral at Fairlee, and he
hoped to renew the happiness of the last two
hours in many agreeable walks and drives in the
splendid scenes of Lochleven. Christobelle
trusted Lord Farnborough's polite wishes might
indeed be fulfilled; she was quite willing to be
pleased by the society of a pleasant young man,
whose conversation was so entertaining, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
appeared to be so gifted in the arts of music,
painting, and poetry&mdash;arts so admired and valued
by her taste. She told his lordship she was
sure her mother would receive his visits with
pleasure. "But will <i>you</i> receive them with
pleasure?" he asked, as the little vessel glided
into the cove from which it embarked; "will
<i>you</i>, Miss Wetheral, admit my visits with pleasure,
and allow me sometimes to join you in
your walks and musings?"</p>

<p>How could Christobelle object? yet she made
no reply, or even answered his appealing look.
The young lord's countenance fell.</p>

<p>"You will not speak to me, Miss Wetheral;
you will not say I am welcome at Fairlee sometimes."</p>

<p>"My mother will be glad to see you, I am
sure, Lord Farnborough," she replied, confusedly,
a second time.</p>

<p>"My wish is to join you occasionally in your
rides, Miss Wetheral, and <i>you</i> must assure me I
shall not be considered an intruder."</p>

<p>Christobelle's confusion increased at this speech,
and at the earnest look which Lord Farnborough
cast upon her. She could only stammer forth
an assurance that she must be very happy also
to see his lordship whenever he paid a visit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Fairlee; and that assurance gave her companion
confidence to urge the necessity of escorting her
to the very door of her home. This Christobelle
declined, with a seriousness which forbade remonstrance;
she had Janet with her, and Fairlee
lay too near the lake to allow of any fears
for her safety. She, therefore, took leave of his
lordship, as he assisted her to quit the little
vessel which belonged to the Cove of Fairlee,
and which her father dedicated to her exclusive
use. Lord Farnborough lingered a few moments.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, we shall meet again before
the party to St. Mungo's Isle takes place."</p>

<p>"When may we expect you at Fairlee, my
lord?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow. Promise me you will not go
out till I come."</p>

<p>"I seldom leave the grounds before two
o'clock. Remember the effusions you promised
I should see."</p>

<p>"Will you read them, and judge a poor poet
mercifully?"</p>

<p>"I shall say exactly what I think, my lord."</p>

<p>"Then I stand condemned at once."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; adieu, my lord!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"But one moment, Miss Wetheral. How
anxious you are to escape!"</p>

<p>"I have left my mother some hours alone. I
must return to her, and account for my absence,
Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"It is not anxiety then to leave me, to get
rid of me, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Then farewell for many dull hours. The
Douglas Isle will have no charms for me, since
the genius of Lochleven is withdrawn."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough respectfully bowed, and re-entered
the boat. Christobelle went forwards
with Janet, but curiosity induced her to look
back upon the lake, as they gained a rising
ground about five hundred yards from the shore.
The vessel was again traversing the water, and
Lord Farnborough was watching their receding
steps, as he stood with folded arms in the stern
of the mimic sloop. He waved his handkerchief
as Christobelle stood for a moment to contemplate
the scene; she waved her plaid in answer
to the signal. Twice were the signals exchanged,
at separate intervals, till a grove of firs closed
the lake from her view; and then she walked
on, slowly and silently to the house.</p>

<p>She did not utter a word to her companion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and attendant, the patient Janet; her mind was
revolving the events of the day, and it dwelt with
peculiar interest upon the unexpected appearance
of Lord Farnborough and his family, on a
solitary island of Lochleven. It was most extraordinary
that her introduction to Lord Farnborough
should take place then and there&mdash;that
her first interview with the Selgrave of former
days, whose very name brought tears into her
eyes, should be one of extreme interest&mdash;nay,
of growing intimacy; that she was now to be
accompanied in her rides and walks by this once
hated lord; and that, without an effort on her
mother's part, they had themselves agreed to
draw, to sing, to become companions together,
in the wild mountains of Scotland, when none
were near to urge the introduction, or plan the
scheme of their amusements.</p>

<p>While her mother lay in darkness, dwelling
upon the evil destiny of Clara, ignorant even of
her amusements, she had become known to
the Selgrave of her former speculation; and
without her knowledge and concurrence, his lordship
was engaged to visit Fairlee! How wonderfully
did events arrange themselves without human
interference, and how foolishly did she, in
younger days, reject the idea of becoming acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with a young man whom she had never
seen, and could not justly deprecate! How
could she ever attach a feeling of dislike to a
creature so intelligent, so agreeable, so very attentively
polite! How rash to judge of any
human being, unknown and unseen!</p>

<p>Whatever her youthful fancy conjured up to
deform the image of "Lord Selgrave" in her
mental reveries, not a feeling separate from admiration
and pleased remembrance hovered round
her meditations upon Lord Farnborough, at this
period of time. Christobelle was deeply engaged
with her own thoughts when she entered
the hall at Fairlee. Silence reigned in its precincts,
and she looked forward to hours of irritable
conference with her mother, ere she could
press her silent pillow, and think unrestrainedly
of all that had passed. Yet, she heard voices in
the sitting-room; and, above all, she heard her
mother's voice in its long-lost tones of playfulness,
addressing a stranger. She heard two
voices reply. One she recognized to be her
father's beloved tones. He was then arrived:
he had fulfilled his word of promise to be
with her on her birthday at last! Christobelle
entered the room in haste, and flew into his
arms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you could not return so soon,
papa; I had quite given up the idea of seeing
you till June: how good this is of you, my own
dear papa!"</p>

<p>"I have kept my word, Chrystal, to salute
you upon your birthday. I made great efforts
to achieve the journey in time, and I have
brought another friend to congratulate you upon
your looks and studies." Christobelle turned
towards the stranger, and a cry of pleasure burst
from her lips; it was Sir John Spottiswoode.
The sight of her instructor, her companion, her
kindest friend, at once obliterated all other
thoughts, and she caught his offered hand with
feelings of most enviable enjoyment. She had
now again a companion to ramble with, to talk
with. She would no more mourn under her
mother's petulance, or roam the borders of Lochleven
unattended. Christobelle did say to him
at that joyful moment&mdash;and she said it in sincerity&mdash;"Oh!
now I <i>shall</i> be happy&mdash;now I
<i>shall</i> have you always with me again!"</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode expressed his equal
pleasure at the meeting, and he complimented
Christobelle upon her appearance of perfect
health. It was a grateful satisfaction to find
she had not forgotten him. He remembered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with interest, their former studies, and he expected
to be astonished by her rapid progress in
every pursuit, during the long interregnum of
four years. Christobelle assured him of his
mistake.</p>

<p>"I have been a wild creature for years, and,
except in drawing and music, I have not done
credit to your instructions. You will be obliged
to begin my education again, Sir John."</p>

<p>"Bell is a dear, flighty girl," said Lady
Wetheral, in affectionate accents, which had
never yet gladdened her daughter's heart at
Fairlee&mdash;"Bell is wild as the curlews upon the
lake. She requires your society to tame her
flights. She has been absent now three long
hours."</p>

<p>"I have seen extraordinary things, and extraordinary
people," Christobelle exclaimed, as she
doffed her mountain-cap, and took Sir John
Spottiswoode's offered seat.</p>

<p>"In that dress, my love?&mdash;surely not in that
dress, Bell?"</p>

<p>"I have been among the high ones of the
land," continued Christobelle, in high spirits,
delighted at being with her father, and near Sir
John Spottiswoode. "I have been among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
gay Southrons in Douglas Isle, and a peer of the
realm has escorted me across the lake."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral looked incredulous, and somewhat
offended. Christobelle was obliged to detail
the events of the morning, to mitigate the
rising storm; and what a change came over her
ladyship's countenance, as her daughter mentioned
the attention and intended visit of Lord
Farnborough!&mdash;joy sparkled in her eyes, and
excitement drew her form to its utmost height.
She did not answer&mdash;words were too feeble to
express her deep gratification.</p>

<p>"What sort of a looking person is Lord
Farnborough, now?" asked Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Most intelligent, most agreeable," she replied,
"but not handsome. I do not consider
him handsome."</p>

<p>"Are they here for any length of time?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell; they attend a party to St.
Mungo's Isle soon, which I am engaged to join.
But <i>you</i> will go with me now: I shall delight
in shewing you the lions of Lochleven. Shall
we take a walk after dinner? I long to shew
you the beauteous spots, where I have sat so
often and so long, thinking of England, and wishing
you were here to enjoy it with me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am ready to attend you over hill and dale,"
replied Sir John Spottiswoode&mdash;"over mountain,
and through glen."</p>

<p>"That is delightful. After dinner, then, we
will set forth."</p>

<p>Christobelle had a packet of letters to read
from Shropshire, entrusted to her father's care;
and, till the dressing-bell sounded, she was engaged
in devouring their contents. All were
well in England. Isabel wrote only of her children,
and she wished to exhibit them at Fairlee,
if Miss Tabitha's health would only allow the
visit&mdash;but she would neither die nor get well.
Anna Maria detailed the delights of the winter's
sport in Shropshire, and triumphed in the glory
of her husband. They had thirty-seven "brushes"
of the last season, which the children played with
in the hall, and Tom had been in at the death of
each. The eldest boy, Tom, could roar "Tally-ho"
as loud as the whipper-in, and the girl
climbed trees like a squirrel. Mrs. Pynsent
added a short postscript of one line, "Take care
of Sir Jacky, Miss Bell."</p>

<p>Christobelle involuntarily raised her eyes towards
Sir John Spottiswoode, as she smiled at
the concise charge. He was gazing earnestly
upon her; her eye sank under the expression of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
his fixed attention, and she resumed her reading;
but a deep blush painfully suffused her cheek.
She had met no closely-fixed observation till this
moment, and she knew Sir John Spottiswoode's
eye was still upon her. She did not dare meet
his glance again.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>"And you really have wished to lead me
through these romantic scenes?" said Sir John
Spottiswoode, as Christobelle leaned upon his
arm, on the very spot where she parted with Lord
Farnborough in the morning; "you have seriously
thought of your old friend during his absence,
and wished him with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; every storm which disturbed the lake,
and every sunny gleam which gilded its tranquillity,
made me think of you, and wish you by
my side to enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was equally anxious to find myself
strolling with you on these magnificent
shores."</p>

<p>"You were otherwise engaged," she replied,
quickly; "you had affairs to arrange, and property
to amuse and interest your thoughts; but
I have had no companion for years, to enliven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
my hours of solitary walks. I thought of you,
when you were too busy to consider me."</p>

<p>"My thoughts were not always employed in
Worcestershire, Miss Wetheral; but take me to
your haunts, and let me see the views you have
so long contemplated."</p>

<p>Christobelle led her companion to the cliff,
where she usually passed her morning hours in
alternate reading and meditation, and they seated
themselves in a natural, rocky seat, which had
been worn by time into something like a shapely
kind of arbour, for the rock arched over their
heads sufficiently deep to afford shelter against
heat and showers; and under its rudely constructed
roof Christobelle had passed many hours
of each successive day, when the weather permitted
her to escape from Fairlee. She pointed
the attention of her friend to the grandly-indented
cliffs which guarded Lochleven&mdash;the
islets which appeared to slumber on its bosom&mdash;the
plain of Kinross&mdash;its humble abodes&mdash;its
little church, and the solitary magnificence of
the whole scene. "Confess," she said, "that
this is a scene worthy to compete with the
boasted views abroad. Confess that Lochleven
is matchless in its golden sunset, its bracing air,
and calmly-beautiful waters. Does not this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
glowing scene fill your mind with wonder and
praise? does it not give soothing thoughts of a
great and wonderful Providence, who has created
such scenes for his creatures?"</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode stood some time in
contemplation, and he was silent during his companion's
enthusiastic descriptions: at last, he
turned towards her with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have seen many lakes&mdash;beautiful lakes,
Miss Wetheral, but I cannot say I ever looked
upon their scenery with the feelings I now enjoy,
in gazing upon Lochleven."</p>

<p>"You will admire every bend of this graceful
water," she replied, pleased with his admiring
gaze, as he fixed his eyes upon Lochleven; "I
must shew you every lovely appendage by degrees.
To-morrow we will visit the ferry of
Ballahuish&mdash;no, not to-morrow...."</p>

<p>"And why not to-morrow?" asked Sir John
Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>Christobelle could not tell why she coloured
at the question, or why she turned her face from
the speaker towards the Douglas Isle. Sir John
Spottiswoode repeated his question.</p>

<p>"But why not to-morrow, Miss Wetheral?
Why cannot we begin our tour to-morrow?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe the Duke of Forfar calls at Fairlee
to-morrow," she replied.</p>

<p>"Will that detain <i>you</i>?" said her companion,
looking at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Not altogether&mdash;no. Lord Farnborough
said something about coming too; and, as he
named the time, I think perhaps I ought to
remain at home."</p>

<p>"I do not know the nature of the understanding
implied by the mention of the intended visit
to you," observed Sir John Spottiswoode, "therefore
I cannot offer an opinion."</p>

<p>"Oh! there was nothing implied&mdash;no absolute&mdash;I
made no promise of any kind."</p>

<p>"You did not engage to remain at Fairlee?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not&mdash;no, I may say, certainly
not."</p>

<p>"Then let us proceed on our little tour to-morrow."</p>

<p>Christobelle was caught in her own mesh.
She had assuredly made no engagement&mdash;no
actual engagement; but there was an implied
consent on her part to Lord Farnborough's hope
of finding her at home. She had not courage
to confess this to Sir John Spottiswoode&mdash;and
why was she guilty of evasion? She must now
relinquish all thought of meeting Lord Farnborough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
at Fairlee. Christobelle sat meditating
her disappointment for some moments.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral," said her companion, after a
short silence, "did you ever see Lord Farnborough
before the meeting of this morning?"</p>

<p>Christobelle started at the sound of Lord
Farnborough's name, but she answered truly,
"Never."</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with his lordship's character?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; my only knowledge of Lord
Farnborough began, and may perhaps end, in
this morning's interview."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough's character at college was
designated as fair and false," observed Sir John
Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Was it!"</p>

<p>"A fellow-collegian of his lordship's, Beverly,
resides near Alverton. He gave me the character
I now describe to you."</p>

<p>Christobelle felt uncomfortable at Sir John
Spottiswoode's information. It is always painful
to hear depreciating accounts of those we
admire, or from whom we have received kindness.
She knew nothing of Lord Farnborough&mdash;his
lordship was nothing to her; but she
regretted so agreeable a person should prove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
otherwise than estimable. Could Mr. Beverly's
testimony be depended upon? Character should
not be lightly treated: if Lord Farnborough's
character was at the mercy of Mr. Beverly, it
was but fair to ascertain Mr. Beverly's claims
to belief. Under this impression, Christobelle
hastily uttered her thoughts, after a second
pause.</p>

<p>"Pray, Sir John, who is Mr. Beverly?"</p>

<p>"A neighbour in Worcestershire, and one of
the best fellows in England. Why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I think your friend is ungenerous,
in speaking harshly of Lord Farnborough, who
perhaps never offended him."</p>

<p>"Beverly was once deeply offended by Lord
Farnborough," replied Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Therefore, your friend is revengeful," she
answered, quickly.</p>

<p>"Beverly has borne his injuries like a man,
and like a Christian," returned Sir John. "All
injuries should be forgiven; but some cannot be
forgotten till memory fails."</p>

<p>Again the little band of French horns swelled
upon the still air, and the two vessels, which had
sailed to the Douglas Isle, emerged from its deep
shadow. Christobelle started up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are returning to Clanmoray so late!
Oh! listen to that sweet, soft air."</p>

<p>The simple strain of "Farewell to Lochaber"
stole softly on their ear, and they sat silently
gazing upon the little vessels, as they neared the
cliff. Suddenly the music broke off, as if an
accident had occurred; but the pause was of
short duration&mdash;it was again broken by the lively
and stirring notes of "My love she's but a lassie
yet." The blood mounted to Christobelle's forehead
with undisguised pleasure and surprise.
She was discovered in her retreat by the party
below, and an indescribable feeling shot across
her heart, as it grasped at the idea that Lord
Farnborough had chosen the air, and that he had
commanded its execution, as the vessel passed
the cliff. She leaned over the rocks, which
formed a barricade before the rural seat, and in
fancy she could distinguish the tall, slight figure
of his lordship, standing in the stern, with folded
arms, as he stood when she waved her plaid in
the morning. Christobelle watched the vessel
with intense attention, as it glided on, and
exclaimed, with eager satisfaction,</p>

<p>"I see him!&mdash;I could point him out among a
hundred!"</p>

<p>"Whom do you see?" asked Sir John Spottiswoode,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
as he rose and advanced to her side&mdash;"Whom
are you noting?"</p>

<p>Christobelle did not immediately reply. She
continued gazing upon the lake, and several of
the party were also observing them through their
telescopes from below.</p>

<p>"But, tell me, Miss Wetheral, whom you note
among a hundred, in that party," repeated Sir
John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"He is standing with&mdash;no, he is sitting&mdash;that
very large personage, the Duke of Forfar&mdash;you
know the Duke of Forfar?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I see. How gratified his Grace
would be at the knowledge of having attracted
your observation! I think I see Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"Whom do you see?&mdash;I fancy I recognise Lady
Anna Herbert's feather; and there is kind Miss
Ponsonby," replied Christobelle, colouring.</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough is standing in the stern
of the vessel, Miss Wetheral: he is waving something&mdash;his
handkerchief. Who is he waving to?"</p>

<p>A little conscious feeling prevented Christobelle
from returning the salutation. She feared
Sir John Spottiswoode would observe and smile
at her action. She wished he had not told her
Lord Farnborough was considered "fair and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
false." She had no belief in the insinuation,
but it caused a very unpleasant restraint. The
vessel passed under the jutting rocks immediately
below them, and it was obscured for a
time: when it reappeared, the distance did not
allow them to distinguish the party. They heard
the full notes of the French horns, however, till
a headland concealed the vessels from sight;
and, ere the last faint note died away, the sun
was considerably below the horizon. Christobelle
and her companion returned to Fairlee at
the moment the servants were passing through
the hall with coffee.</p>

<p>The evening passed in conversation upon the
past and present, and Sir John Spottiswoode's
society made Christobelle speedily forget the
attentions of Lord Farnborough. The compliments
of an attractive and agreeable person, for
a few hours, could not compete with the presence
of a dear friend, whose taste had led her
own in many instances, and who had devoted so
much time to accomplish her talents for music
and painting. That friend had been remembered
during an absence of four years; he had been
often apostrophized in solitary walks, and she
had wished in silence and sincerity to renew
their pleasant intercourse. That boon was now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
granted. Sir John Spottiswoode was again her
companion, and what desire of her heart remained
ungratified?</p>

<p>Christobelle laid her head upon her pillow,
that night, in peaceful thoughts; and if Lord
Farnborough occasionally flitted before her eyes&mdash;if
the air of "My love is but a lassie yet"
lingered upon her ear&mdash;yet Sir John Spottiswoode
filled her mind. His dark hair, curling
in rich profusion over his brow&mdash;his manly expression&mdash;that
benevolent dark blue eye&mdash;who
was equal to him in excellence?&mdash;nay, who was
superior, even in those evanescent gifts which
captivate the eye of woman? Whom did she
love and venerate equal to Sir John Spottiswoode?</p>

<p>The following morning produced a long and
perplexing conversation between the mother and
daughter, which extinguished all Christobelle's
happy feelings. No two beings could possibly
be more opposed in feeling, in sentiment, and in
action; and never yet did a colloquy take place,
without heart-burning arising on one side, and
distressed feelings on the other part, to sever
the ties between parent and child. In this
morning's conference their opinions jarred more
painfully than ever; for they were now in actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
collision upon points which must materially
affect Christobelle's happiness, and her future
respectability of conduct. It took place after
breakfast, while the gentlemen were perambulating
the terrace, and ordering the horses for
an intended ride. Lady Wetheral commenced
her attack with that flattering address which
gains so much influence over poor human nature.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, the arrival of your old friend
has produced wonderful effects. I am gratified
at seeing your eyes sparkle, and your expression
of countenance become animated. I may confess
I am pleased at beholding my quiet daughter
transformed into a beauty, by the mere play
of pretty coquetry which Sir John Spottiswoode's
arrival has called forth."</p>

<p>"I detest coquettes and coquetry," answered
Christobelle, seriously, though she was not insensible
to the agreeable intimation of her suddenly
acquired beauty.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Bell; it is a woman's most potent
argument&mdash;it is her most powerful weapon&mdash;it
is her most precious gift&mdash;because it is her
greatest attraction: do not undervalue it."</p>

<p>"I have not been many hours in Sir John
Spottiswoode's company, mamma. If I felt inclined
to coquet, I have had no opportunity."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"A mother's eyes are open, when the daughter's
eyes are closed," replied Lady Wetheral,
with her most winning smile. "I dare say you
were not aware how prettily your eyes sought,
and fell beneath Sir John's glances, last night,
and at this morning's breakfast. I congratulate
you, Bell, upon a gift which will create more
decided effects from your ignorance of possessing
it. But I wish to call your attention to my
anxious wishes&mdash;I wish you to attend to my
counsel, and I wish you to act by my advice."</p>

<p>"What is your counsel, mamma?"</p>

<p>"I have never yet failed in establishing my
daughters," her ladyship continued, "because
they acted upon my advice, without arguing its
propriety. Julia and Clara acted solely by my
wishes, and they won their high establishment."</p>

<p>"Poor Clara!" exclaimed Christobelle, involuntarily.</p>

<p>"It is useless to pity those who would not
conform to the proprieties of life," replied Lady
Wetheral. "I gave Clara to Sir Foster, with
long and serious entreaties to avoid all public
scenes and altercations with her husband. I
never countenanced opposition in a wife. I implored
Clara to be obedient in appearance&mdash;so
much can be done by prudent management! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
never contradicted her father in my life. I
effected all my plans without a single quarrel.
There is no occasion to quarrel in matrimony.
A woman's influence is and must be felt; but it
ends the instant you appear to contend. Clara
was ungrateful to reproach me as the cause&mdash;the
idea always makes me nervous."</p>

<p>Her ladyship applied lavender-water to her
forehead and handkerchief, and then proceeded.</p>

<p>"Sir John Spottiswoode will propose to you
before he quits Fairlee, but I should wish"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir John Spottiswoode propose to <i>me</i>!" exclaimed
Christobelle, in the utmost astonishment.</p>

<p>"All that surprise is foolish, Bell. You are
now old enough to command those starts and
blushes which look so very fresh, so very girlish.
I am certain Sir John Spottiswoode will propose,
and it rests with yourself to attract Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>The blood rushed with impetuous pulsation
into the face of Christobelle, and it overspread
her forehead, neck, and even her hands: if Lady
Wetheral observed the suffusion her words had
produced, she affected not to perceive it.</p>

<p>"I should advise you to be very cautious in
your conduct to both gentlemen, my dear Bell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Do not be seen too exclusively with Sir John
Spottiswoode, to attract attention; and yet, do
not check hope on his part. If Lord Farnborough
quits Clanmoray without intending any
thing, or merely flirts with you, then, let Sir
John propose. Alverton is an excellent <i>au pis
aller</i>, but I would rather my dear Bell could be
saluted Duchess of Forfar."</p>

<p>It was some moments before Christobelle could
rally her thoughts and spirits, after the mention
of Lord Farnborough, in the light of a future
suitor. For one instant, only, the idea of his
lordship's affection shot a gleam of ambition into
her mind, but the paltry feeling was soon extinguished
for ever, and her heart flew back to the
remembered excellence of her former instructor
and friend. Her mother watched the workings
of her spirit.</p>

<p>"If Lord Farnborough calls to-day, my love,
I shall invite him to dinner."</p>

<p>"His lordship is a guest at Clanmoray," observed
Christobelle, hastily.</p>

<p>"He will be a guest at Fairlee soon," answered
my mother, gaily. "I could fancy myself
quite well again, my dear child; quite alert,
as I used to be; your little '<i>minauderies</i>' will
raise me into new life and spirits. I am sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I am sure he is clever and agreeable; your
little coquetries will divert me into health again."</p>

<p>"But, mamma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No 'ifs' and 'buts,' my dear Bell. I have
every dependence upon your attractions. Sir
John Spottiswoode is astonished at your improved
appearance."</p>

<p>"Listen to me, if you please, mamma. I am
no coquette; and I would rather die than be
considered a character so repugnant to all that
is holy and upright."</p>

<p>"My dear girl, forbear sentiment. A little
sentiment, if you please, to Lord Farnborough,
but not to me."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to marry, mamma," pleaded
Christobelle, with earnest seriousness. "I have
no wish to leave papa, and&mdash;I have no wish to
marry Sir John Spottiswoode, and I cannot try
to attract any body. Pray, do not advise me
to avoid Sir John, or to think of any establishment.
Don't let me endure the fate of Clara,
or Julia's long banishment."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's hands began to tremble, and
her features became agitated as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I am well used to disobedience, and this
only adds to my accumulation of vexations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and I have one child left to reproach me with
bitterness. How could I expect obedience from
a headstrong girl, whose masculine education defies
restraint!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, mamma, I am anxious to do right.
Indeed, my wish is to please every one; but I
cannot think it right to treat Sir John Spottiswoode
ill."</p>

<p>"Who enjoins you to do so?" said her ladyship,
in a querulous tone.</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;indeed, I cannot trifle with two
gentlemen, till I ascertain the intentions of one
of them. Do not ask me to do so, I beseech
you, for it goes against every feeling of my heart."
Christobelle burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I detest such stupid folly! Pray, don't
imagine that your frowns will destroy the peace
of either gentlemen. Men do not now suffer
more than an hour's annoyance; a new flame
soon lights the expiring embers of an old <i>penchant</i>."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it, mamma."</p>

<p>"I only counsel you to mete out your attentions
to each gentleman alike, Bell, and to distinguish
neither at present. I imagine nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
unholy in a line of conduct which preserves a
proper and just decorum in your manners."</p>

<p>"I will do any thing you please, mamma;
only do not ask me to trifle with Sir John Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>"You will do every thing which pleases yourself,
and nothing which pleases me. I perfectly
understand your meaning; but allow me also
to observe, that I will hold no intercourse with
a daughter who presumes to lecture her parent.
I will have no communication with a young woman
who insolently defies her mother, and insists
upon acting according to her own weak
judgment."</p>

<p>"Do not suppose me defying you, mamma.
There is nothing I would not do to give you
pleasure&mdash;nothing I would not do to increase
your comforts; only I beseech you not to compel
me into a conduct my heart disowns as ungenerous
and wicked."</p>

<p>"Of course, a parent is wrong&mdash;of course, a
mother is not a proper judge, compared with a
child's greater wisdom, in any affair connected
with that child's welfare. I am aware of your
high opinion of yourself. I have long known
your freedom, from every proper feeling which
softens and decorates a woman's mind. Remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
single, Bell, and be the prototype of your great
aunt, Miss Christobelle Wetheral; sink like her
into insignificant old maidism. But don't let
my eyes contemplate you, an excrescence in
your family&mdash;an incubus upon its glory. All
my daughters have married splendidly, and I cannot
be encumbered by a stupid daughter, who
throws every advantage from her, and considers
an admirer an unholy appendage."</p>

<p>Tears flowed silently down her daughter's
cheeks. Christobelle could hold no dialogue
with a mother, whose ironical manner and determinedly
opposed views distressed her, and
darkened the prospect of her life. Her silence
became a matter of offence.</p>

<p>"If weeping is to accompany your talent for
continual and insolent opposition, Miss Wetheral,
I will request you to leave me: my own nerves
are sufficiently shattered."</p>

<p>Christobelle rose, and quitted the room; Sir
John Spottiswoode came towards her from the
hall, as she closed the door of the breakfast-room.
He did not notice her emotion; he did
not even speak, but he gently drew her arm
within his own, and led her upon the terrace
which commanded the view of the lake. They
took one turn in silence, and then Sir John Spottiswoode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
spoke of his admiration of Lochleven,
and gradually drew Christobelle into cheerful
conversation. He asked her opinion concerning
the morning's plan of amusement. "If she did
not prefer riding, he should feel inclined to consider
the day just the very thing for a water excursion."
Christobelle was very willing to resign
herself into Sir John's hands. The conversation
of the morning had damped the glow of
pleasure, and given a melancholy tinge to her
thoughts, which could not be immediately shaken
off. She therefore answered slowly&mdash;"Yes, any
thing; let us go upon the water, if you wish it."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode pressed her arm to
his side so slightly, that she could scarcely write
it down a pressure, as he replied:</p>

<p>"I will have nothing done without your full
concurrence. If you do not feel inclined to go
on the water, let the original plan be adopted."</p>

<p>"I believe my tones are rather dismal this
morning," she replied, with more cheerfulness;
"but I quite approve of your idea. We will
certainly row to the Douglas Isle."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral accompanied them in their
little excursion; and as they glided towards the
Isle, the fresh air, the light dip of the oars, and
the conversation of her two companions, restored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Christobelle's spirit to its usual buoyancy.
Sir John Spottiswoode watched the ebb and
flow of her countenance, and bent towards her.
"This is perfect enchantment. Tell me now
why you were so melancholy."</p>

<p>Christobelle shook her head smilingly. "Do
not put me in mind of it, but sing me a Swiss
air; that air I loved to hear at Wetheral."</p>

<p>"You have remembered it, even among these
distant scenes?"</p>

<p>"It has never faded from my recollection.
On the contrary, these rocks and mountains
brought it still more freshly to memory."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode instantly sang the
Swiss air with spirit, and his voice sounded
melodiously on the water, which lay so calmly,
so beautifully still: not a breath of air curled
a ripple upon its surface. Again and again
the song recommenced, and all Christobelle's
troubles were forgotten in the delicious harmony.
She did not know she sat gazing upon
the singer, till Sir John Spottiswoode suddenly
paused, and their eyes met: Christobelle
was not aware her attention was so exclusively
bestowed upon him, till the expression of his
glance recalled her thoughts. She turned from
him in confusion, and fixed her contemplation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
upon the mountains which rose gradually above
each other, till their heads were lost in clouds.
She looked no more towards Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>The little party sat conversing some hours on
a small pile of stones raised under a tree, which,
in former days, constituted the <i>plaisance</i> of
Lochleven Castle. This spot commanded the
rich plain of Kinross, the rocky hills which
swelled on either side, and the houses which
dotted the plain, and gleamed in the sunshine.
They thought of the sufferings of Mary, when
she inhabited the now-ruined building under
which they reposed, not as a restless Queen of
Scots, but as a captive woman, banished to an
isle where her eye could only rest upon rocks
and water, far from her home and friends.</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode also told of foreign
scenes, and compared the beauties of Lochleven
with the gigantic lakes of the south. They
could not bear comparison; yet Lochleven possessed,
in its diminutiveness, every requisite for
poetic beauty. It was Lochleven; and Lochleven
contained a succession of captivating
scenery, delighting to the eye and mind. Many
might prefer the imposing immensity of Geneva,
of Constance, or of Zurich; but all must admire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Lochleven. He did not see the chamois bounding
from cliff to cliff; but the mind loved to repose
on the bold yet tranquil scene which he
contemplated. He did not dread the avalanche;
but the softer landscape pleased an eye, sated
with precipices, glaziers, torrents, and cataracts.
It was delightful to sit by the side of friends, in
the midst of scenery so beautiful, and yet be
able to say, "It is in our own land."</p>

<p>Christobelle listened, and forgot Lord Farnborough.
Far more attractive to her mind was
the manly conversation of Sir John Spottiswoode,
than the empty compliments of a new
acquaintance. How could she, for an instant,
feel disappointment at the thought of being
absent from Fairlee when his lordship called?</p>

<p>Their return to the mainland was late; it was
later still when they reached Fairlee. They had
lingered by the way, and every turn presented
new objects to admire, and fresh subjects for
discussion. The half-hour bell was pealing its
tones, and the echo reverberated from rock to
rock, as they gained the terrace. This incident
produced another pause: Sir John described
the effect of the echo among the mountains
of Switzerland, and the wild cry of
the Switzers. Christobelle had scarcely time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to hurry into her room, and change her dress,
before they were summoned into the dining-room.
Lady Wetheral did not address her
daughter during dinner. She directed her discourse
exclusively to her husband, when any
subject was intended particularly to attract
Christobelle's attention; otherwise, her manners
were captivating as ever, when she played the
hospitable and agreeable hostess, at the head of
her table.</p>

<p>"My dear John, the Duke of Forfar called
this morning." Christobelle's colour rose, and
her quick eye detected the little emotion. "I
was gratified by the call: his Grace looked remarkably
well, and Lady Anna Herbert as
sprightly as usual. Four years have rolled by,
and left their 'flowing hair' unthinned. Lady
Anna looks quite as youthful as she did when a
'<i>belle confessed</i>,' at your mother's balls, Sir John
Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>"She was a very fine girl, and an excellent
flirt," remarked Sir John. "Charles and Lady
Anna were great friends some years ago."</p>

<p>"I was very much pleased with Lord Farnborough,"
continued Lady Wetheral, addressing
her husband, and passing her eyes slightly over
Christobelle. "Lord Farnborough accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gentleman many years."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode made no remark; and
Christobelle was silent. Sir John Wetheral
asked if the great boy had grown into a fine-looking
youth?</p>

<p>"I set Lord Farnborough down as decidedly
handsome at the first glance, my love; but I
forgot his beauty in his very finished manners."</p>

<p>Sir John made no further remark, and there
was a short pause, till Lady Wetheral resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough spoke with polite pleasure
of his introduction to my daughter yesterday;
and he brought a note from Miss Ponsonby,
requesting us to join a party next Tuesday
to St. Mungo's Isle. You were included,
Sir John, when our friends learned you were at
Fairlee."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode bowed.</p>

<p>"It is to be an early party, and there were
sundry messages delivered which my poor head
could not contain; but Lord Farnborough will
call again with more ample instructions. I told
him it was cruel to load my memory with such
matter."</p>

<p>"Do the Forfar party continue long at Clanmoray,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
said Sir John Spottiswoode, some moments
after the subject had dropped.</p>

<p>"I believe so," was Lady Wetheral's reply;
"indeed, Lord Farnborough mentioned his own
protracted stay, when the rest left for Farnborough
Stacy. I forget when <i>they</i> depart."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is attractive metal in Miss
Fanny Ponsonby," observed Sir John Wetheral.</p>

<p>"There is attraction somewhere," replied his
lady, "for there was a lover's touch in his description
of Lochleven, and in his anxiety for
the party to St. Mungo's Isle."</p>

<p>"Allow me the pleasure of taking wine with
you, Miss Wetheral," said Sir John Spottiswoode,
bending forward. The subject again
dropped.</p>

<p>The half hour's interregnum after dinner, was
passed in lectures on Lady Wetheral's part.
The ladies had scarcely entered the drawing-room,
when Christobelle's attention was again
required upon the subject so painfully argued
in the morning.</p>

<p>"I wish to try your narrow capacity once
more, Bell, and to ascertain whether you really
possess one spark of that wholesome ambition
which dignifies a woman of birth."</p>

<p>"Indeed, mamma, I hope so. I would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for worlds stoop to commit a mean action, or
indulge a mean thought. My very greatest ambition
is to act like a lady, and, by so doing,
meet every one's respect."</p>

<p>"That is all very well, Bell, but that is not
exactly my meaning. To be respectable, you
must soar. It is vain to content one's-self with
grovelling just above the heads of the canaille.
The proper ambition is to grasp at high things,
and possess them."</p>

<p>"I have no wish for high things, mamma."</p>

<p>"Because your nature is common-place, Bell,
because your mind is low set. However you
may pique yourself upon your accomplished education,
that very education has crippled my
hopes, and your own prospects. You will live
and die, satisfied with mediocrity."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, what do you mean, and what
am I to do to give you satisfaction? I cannot
understand you."</p>

<p>"I will explain myself, Bell. Are you a girl
of such a mean spirit, as to accept a baronet,
when a duke's son enters the list of suitors?
Answer me&mdash;are you so mean-spirited, so mediocre
in your wishes, as to content yourself
with a man who cannot raise you above your
fellows?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not, mamma, if I did not love
him."</p>

<p>"Love him! Could you love a man&mdash;would
you dare to plead attachment to a man, as an
excuse for lowering yourself in marriage below
your sisters' fortunes? Would <i>you</i> meanly creep,
while <i>their</i> flight has carried them to this world's
pinnacle? I hope, I trust, you would not do so,
Bell!"</p>

<p>"Whom can you allude to?" exclaimed Christobelle,
distressed beyond measure at her mother's
words; "tell me at once, I beseech you,
what you mean. Do not speak to me in parables."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral became extremely agitated.
She walked to the window, threw open the sash,
and closed it again, as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I have said enough to waken your understanding.
Any one might comprehend my meaning&mdash;any
one would know I detested the idea of
your marrying Sir John Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>Christobelle looked up in her mother's face
with astonishment. She continued with increased
nervousness.</p>

<p>"You cannot deceive <i>me</i>, Bell. You cannot
deny your predilection for that man, which will
at once decide the intentions, and end all hopes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of Lord Farnborough. You are determined to
pursue your will, and I will act upon my own
resolution. The very hour in which you accept
Sir John Spottiswoode, shall be the last of your
residence with me."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, mamma, I have not a thought
of Sir John Spottiswoode, or Sir John Spottiswoode
of me! What can have caused such a
supposition in your mind?"</p>

<p>"You do not care for him&mdash;you <i>will</i> not care
for him&mdash;is that your meaning, Bell?"</p>

<p>"I do not care for any one, half so much as
for my own papa, and I hope I shall always
prefer him," she exclaimed, energetically.</p>

<p>"Folly, and nonsense!&mdash;girl's folly," resumed
Lady Wetheral, "by your blushes I might have
given you credit for ambition; but your walks
and sailing with Sir John Spottiswoode, inclines
me to fear you will give yourself to a poor baronet."</p>

<p>"I did not know he was poor, mamma."</p>

<p>"Comparatively speaking with Sir Foster
Kerrison, he <i>is</i> poor. What is a paltry income
of three thousand pounds, compared with the
wealthy dukedom of Forfar?"</p>

<p>"Am I to marry the Duke of Forfar?" exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Christobelle, starting from her chair in
horror.</p>

<p>"Not the present duke, Bell, though he is a
remarkably fine man, and not more than sixty
years of age. Many young ladies might approve
the Duke of Forfar; but I allude to his very
handsome, very accomplished mannered son."</p>

<p>Christobelle could have listened to her mother's
eulogium with infinite pleasure at an earlier
period, and before she had deprecated Sir John
Spottiswoode. But her soul rose against persecution.
She could not endure to hear her friend
lowered, or to be at once commanded not to like
a man whom she loved in innocence, and without
a thought of future connexion. From that moment,
Sir John Spottiswoode became a martyr in
her eyes, and Lord Farnborough sank into a secondary
personage. Lady Wetheral awaited her
daughter's reply some moments, but her mind
was too busily employed deciding her feelings.</p>

<p>"You are very thoughtful, Bell. Think well
upon my words, and act with becoming spirit."</p>

<p>"I have thought, and I have decided," replied
Christobelle, firmly.</p>

<p>"But do not look so ashy pale, my dear Bell;
these little struggles are trifles, compared with
a long existence of nonentity. I gave up a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
powerful attachment, to please my wise and reflecting
mother. I relinquished Captain Blennerhasset
for your father, and I found her remarks
perfectly just, by the course of events.
She implored me to forbear marrying an Irish
officer, with little more than his pay, when a
prospect arose before me of becoming mistress
of Wetheral Castle. She assured my romantic
fancy, that Love could not survive the attacks
of poverty, and she warned me to avoid the
miseries of following my husband into disagreeable
quarters, where I must sink into a
captain's lady, a title of far less importance than
the general's mistress. I followed my dear mother's
prudent advice, and broke off my engagement
with Blennerhasset."</p>

<p>Christobelle was interested in the fate of her
mother's unfortunate lover, and she asked what
had become of Captain Blennerhasset?</p>

<p>"He married somebody of distinction," she
replied, "and fell at Badajos. His widow and
four children are now living upon the bounty of
their friends. My mother's counsel was wise,
and I was fortunately prevailed upon to act with
propriety."</p>

<p>"Poor Captain Blennerhasset!"</p>

<p>"Poverty is always pitiable," resumed Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Wetheral. "I consider people equally poor,
whose income will not allow them to compete
with their neighbours. I should say poor Lady
Spottiswoode, if you were the wife of our excellent
guest,..."</p>

<p>"Alverton is a handsome estate," remarked
Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Very well for a nobody," replied Lady Wetheral,
haughtily, "but a wretched pittance for
a Miss Wetheral, who has attracted the notice of
Lord Farnborough. I saw his watchful looks
towards the door, Bell. I marked his lordship's
glances towards the lake, when he heard of
your visit to the island; every thing is in your
power, if you will but listen to your mother's
counsel."</p>

<p>"Do not talk to me of marriage, mamma, I
implore you," cried Christobelle, as the gentlemen
entered from the dining-room. Sir John
Spottiswoode took his seat near her as usual;
she thought he looked more benevolent, more
interesting than ever. Matrimony never coupled
itself with her admiration of Sir John, but to be
commanded to approve him less than Lord
Farnborough&mdash;to consider <i>him</i> poor and undesirable,
who had improved her better tastes, and
increased her store of good! No, that should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
never be. Christobelle was too young to wish
to marry, too happy and free to think of fetters:
but her right hand would forget its cunning, ere
she ceased to esteem Sir John Spottiswoode beyond
every human being.</p>

<p>"Shall we walk this evening?" he asked, as
thoughts passed too rapidly through her mind to
allow of speech. Christobelle coloured, and
turned mechanically towards her mother. Lady
Wetheral saw her emotion.</p>

<p>"My dear child looks fatigued, Sir John.
Shall we advise her to be quiet this evening? A
long morning upon the water has lessened her
bloom."</p>

<p>"One little turn upon the terrace only, Miss
Wetheral." Sir John offered his arm.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, even the terrace will fatigue
you," observed her ladyship, with anxiety.</p>

<p>"One turn to watch that sunset, Lady Wetheral!
I will bring Miss Wetheral back before
fatigue attacks her."</p>

<p>"My dear Bell!..."</p>

<p>"I will not detain her many minutes&mdash;<i>one</i>
turn, my pupil."</p>

<p>Christobelle could not resist that title. She
rose, and accompanied Sir John Spottiswoode
upon the terrace. One turn was taken, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
paused to watch the golden beams sink behind
the mountains. Another and another was agreed
upon, just to watch the pale gleams departing.
Was it, indeed, her mother's prohibition which
gave so much interest to her companion's remarks?
Was it her prohibition which threw
a charm over his conversation, and caused Christobelle
to linger in his society? She knew not&mdash;but
it was dark when they returned into
the drawing-room, and the coffee had been forgotten.
Lady Wetheral's eyes turned upon her
daughter with an offended expression, but
Christobelle forgot their glance in pleasing retrospections
that night. Christobelle dreamed of
Sir John Spottiswoode, and their early first days
of acquaintance, when Lady Wetheral approved
and sought his intimacy, and she had enjoyed it
undisturbed, without a reference to Lord Farnborough.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>Lady Wetheral complained the following morning
of her nerves. She assured Sir John Spottiswoode
her alarms about her daughter's health
induced the attacks, and she hoped Christobelle
would not think of quitting Fairlee grounds that
day. When that dear girl was long absent, her
fears became overpowering, and a frequent recurrence
of such disquietude might bring on a serious
illness. She hoped Bell would find amusement
in the house, and be prevailed upon to forego her
long walks. Sir John Spottiswoode should not
suffer by her nervous feelings. She was aware
her husband admired and sought out points of
scenery almost as enthusiastically as Bell, and
he would be delighted to attend him in his
rides.</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode smiled. "I will also
decline leaving the house, if you please. Since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
my pupil has suffered by my selfish pleasures, I
will dedicate myself to her entertainment&mdash;we
will sketch the lake from the terrace."</p>

<p>"That would be most pleasant; but I fear my
poor nerves are in the way again, my dear Sir
John. I do not like to see my daughter bending
over her drawing."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral shall not bend over her drawing:
I will read to you both; I will read the
'Lady of the Lake.'"</p>

<p>"That will be most agreeable&mdash;most entertaining,"
observed her ladyship. "My dear
Bell, you are so partial to Sir Walter Scott's
poems!"</p>

<p>Yes, Christobelle was a warm admirer of Sir
Walter's poetry; but she thought still more of
the pleasure she should experience in hearing it
read aloud by Sir John Spottiswoode. Christobelle
acknowledged "how gratified she would
feel, by hearing the 'Lady of the Lake'&mdash;that she
preferred '<i>la lecture</i>' even to a sketch of the
bright Lochleven. She would bring her netting,
and her father should sit by her in his comfortable
chair."</p>

<p>Every thing was arranged, shortly after the
conclusion of breakfast, for the reading; but, ere
the gentlemen returned from their morning visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to the stables and gardens, Lady Wetheral expressed
her satisfaction at the arrangement.</p>

<p>"I have managed to withdraw you from a
walk, Bell. I dislike those walks. Your name
would soon become coupled with Sir John Spottiswoode,
which I will not allow. If Lord Farnborough
calls to-day, every thing is in its proper
order. Place a chair for the reader, between
your father and myself, my love: our ears are
older than your youthful members."</p>

<p>"I thought the Clanmoray party called yesterday,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"They did so&mdash;and yet I have a presentiment
that Lord Farnborough will appear again to-day.
Remember, Bell, I do not extend my prohibition
to Lord Farnborough. You may walk with
Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"That would give offence to Sir John Spottiswoode,
mamma."</p>

<p>"Leave <i>me</i> to manage Sir John Spottiswoode,
my love."</p>

<p>"I shall not wish to walk; I shall remain at
home to-day, if you please, mamma."</p>

<p>"I do not prescribe your hours, my dear Bell.
Walk when and where you like, so you are not
conspicuous with Sir John Spottiswoode. I
warn you in time, that I will listen to no proposal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which does not emanate from Lord Farnborough;
and no plea from yourself, which has reference
to our present guest. You are warned in time,
remember!"</p>

<p>"I should never think of, or hope to attach,
Sir John Spottiswoode," Christobelle replied,
calmly; "I only wish to be allowed free liberty
to enjoy his conversation."</p>

<p>"There is a very homely adage, Bell, which
says, 'Prevention is better than a cure.' Lay
its meaning to your heart."</p>

<p>Christobelle did not continue the dialogue.
She gave her whole attention to her netting, till
the gentlemen returned, and till Sir John Spottiswoode
commenced his reading: her whole
soul was then engrossed in the fate of the fair
and gentle Ellen. Gradually her hands relaxed
their grasp, as the story proceeded&mdash;gradually
her eyes turned upon the reader, and her netting
fell disregarded upon the carpet. She was listening
to the scene where Malcolm hears the
praises of Ellen from the lips of Douglas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If a father's partial thought<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O'erweighed her worth and beauty aught&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Well might the lover's judgment fail<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To balance with a juster scale;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For with each secret glance he stole,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The fond enthusiast sent his soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>The eyes of Sir John Spottiswoode rested upon
Christobelle as he spoke these lines, and she felt
a pain at her heart before unknown, and now
indescribable. Lady Wetheral caught the mutual
expression, and was struck by the sudden
paleness of her daughter's countenance. She
turned to Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"You will smile at a lady's nerves, and decide
us to be incomprehensible beings; but the
continual flow of your voice vibrates upon my
nerves in a peculiar manner. I <i>must</i> feel unwell,
since a voice like your own creates nervousness.
I will retire, for a short period, to appeal once
more to camphor-julep. My dear Bell will give
me her arm."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode rose in alarm.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, these trifling attacks are becoming
less and less frequent. My daughter and
myself will leave you and Sir John together. I
trust these attacks are not to be often repeated;
but we shall meet at luncheon, I hope, quite
recovered."</p>

<p>The mother and daughter quitted the sitting-room;
but, as they passed through the door,
held open by Sir John Spottiswoode, he took
Christobelle's hand, and kindly hoped she would
not be too ill to enjoy a breeze upon the terrace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"Oh! yes, this evening I shall truly enjoy the
pure air," she replied, withdrawing her hand as
they passed on.</p>

<p>"If there is any thing most displeasing to me,"
observed Lady Wetheral, as they entered her
dressing-room, "it is comprised in that familiar
action of shaking hands upon every occasion.
I beg you will avoid it in future."</p>

<p>"It was merely to express a kind wish, <i>en
passant</i>," Christobelle remarked, "that Sir John
Spottiswoode just touched my hand."</p>

<p>"Familiarity which begins <i>en passant</i>, ends in
contempt <i>pour toujours</i>, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"Would you wish to lie down, mamma, or
shall I ring for Mrs. Bevan?" asked her daughter,
willing to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Neither, Miss Wetheral. I wish simply to
remain here, and, if you please, you shall read
to me."</p>

<p>Christobelle continued reading to her mother,
who sat reclining in a lounging-chair, till a tap
at the door announced Mrs. Bevan in waiting.
Her ladyship touched a little silver hand-bell by
her side, to indicate to Mrs. Bevan that she
might enter. She brought a summons from her
master, to beg the ladies would make their
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell Frederick, Mrs. Bevan, to inform your
master we will descend when the luncheon is
announced: I am very nervous and unwell."</p>

<p>"My lady, I believe my Lord Farnborough is
in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well, Mrs. Bevan, we are coming
immediately." Mrs. Bevan vanished. "My
dear love, just draw out your beautiful curls; and
if you could pass a narrow blue ribbon negligently
through your hair, it would give great
effect to its jetty abundance. A little more animation
in your manner, Bell, and a little less
paleness, is to be desired. Yes, that blush has
had great effect&mdash;now let us proceed, ere it
vanishes."</p>

<p>They entered the drawing-room, and Christobelle's
eyes first sought Sir John Spottiswoode.
He was standing at the window, but he turned
towards the ladies, as the little bustle of their
entrance reached his ear, and advanced with alacrity.
Lady Wetheral held out her hand. "I
am much better, my dear Sir John&mdash;your countenance
asks the question. I have had repose&mdash;perfect
repose&mdash;and I am better. My daughter
is my medicine." Her ladyship still held Christobelle's
arm, and moved gracefully forward.
"My lord, you are the bearer of Miss Ponsonby's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wishes. My poor memory had parted
with the recollection of your message yesterday,
before my daughter's return."</p>

<p>Christobelle bowed to Lord Farnborough, and
would have apologized for her absence the preceding
day, by stating Sir John Spottiswoode's
arrival, had not the attention of the latter been
fixed upon her. She could perceive that he
watched her narrowly, and that knowledge imparted
an awkwardness to her manner which
she could not shake off. Christobelle stopped
abruptly in her speech, and hesitated. Lord
Farnborough had greatly the advantage in perfect
ease of manner. Christobelle felt her insufficiency,
and it caused greater agitation&mdash;for
what would Sir John Spottiswoode think of
her folly?</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough entered gaily into conversation,
and he did not allude to his disappointment,
or recur to the events which had passed.
He was charged with Miss Ponsonby's complimentary
fears lest Christobelle should become a
defaulter to St. Mungo's Isle, and her hopes that
the party would assemble at Clanmoray, before
the aquatic expedition took place. It was
hoped that Lady Wetheral would accompany the
Fairlee party, and forget her fears of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will be under my guidance, Lady Wetheral,"
continued Lord Farnborough, "and I
am an experienced sailor. Ponsonby heads a
detachment also, but I particularly request your
daughter and yourself will place yourselves under
my care."</p>

<p>"We will certainly enlist under your banners,
Lord Farnborough; we prefer the sailor to the
soldier, upon the water," said Lady Wetheral,
her countenance lighted up with pleasure, and
all her ailments forgotten. "I shall accept,
with pleasure, Miss Ponsonby's invitation, and I
will <i>try</i> to forget my fears."</p>

<p>"I shall ride over on Tuesday, to escort you,"
resumed Lord Farnborough. "Since you consider
yourselves my peculiar care, I shall certainly
take charge of you from your own door.
Miss Ponsonby declares, if I monopolize the
ladies, she will insist upon being attended by the
gentlemen. She therefore appropriates Sir John
Wetheral and your guest."</p>

<p>"A charmingly novel arrangement," exclaimed
Lady Wetheral, delighted to believe that Sir
John Spottiswoode would not enter her appointed
vessel. "I am amused by the peculiar
novelty. Tell me who form your exclusive
party?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! I have secured Lady Anna and Fanny
Ponsonby&mdash;Mrs. Ponsonby has declared off altogether&mdash;the
Greys, and the two Quintens."</p>

<p>"The handsome Quintens?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the handsome, tall Quintens&mdash;second
only to the incomparable Fanny Ponsonby."</p>

<p>Christobelle thought Lord Farnborough handsome&mdash;very
handsome, that morning. If Sir
John Spottiswoode had not arrived at Fairlee&mdash;if
Lady Wetheral had not tortured her heart, by
<i>compelling</i> its obedience&mdash;by endeavouring to
lower her opinion of the friend she esteemed&mdash;if,
a thousand ifs&mdash;Christobelle had perhaps admired
his lordship, and fallen a victim to her
mother's wishes. But, now!&mdash;a thousand Lord
Farnboroughs could not fill up the sum of her
preference to the society of Sir John Spottiswoode.
Love was a deity unknown, unwished
for. She only prayed to pass her existence with
her father, and to see sometimes the friend she
so greatly venerated.</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough remained some hours at
Fairlee; and when Christobelle's confusion, which
arose at Sir John Spottiswoode's scrutiny, had
subsided, she could also join in the passing conversation.
Many complimentary nothings fell
from Lord Farnborough's lips, to which she replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with a banter which arose from the collision
of their wits&mdash;not from a heart gratified by empty
verbiage. Christobelle was at rest from reproach;
and her spirits rose from their contact with lively
observations and sprightly repartee.</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode did not join in the
wordy war, but her father smiled in pleased approbation,
and often rescued his daughter from
the horns of a dilemma. Lady Wetheral's satisfaction
lay deep in her heart, but she sat composedly
silent, as the brilliant scintillations of
wit played round her. It was after the departure
of Lord Farnborough, that she spoke her
feelings in one concise, but too dangerous,
sentence.</p>

<p>"Bell, walk <i>now</i> when and where you please,
with Sir John Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>Christobelle was again at liberty to walk by
the side of her friend&mdash;again free to claim his
society, without reproachful looks and unkind
expressions! How joyfully did she avail herself
of the blessed privilege! Her mother
smiled at their repeated absence, and expressed
no curiosity to learn their subjects of conversation.
Christobelle drew fearlessly to the side
of Sir John Spottiswoode, or leaned upon his
arm with confidence, as they watched the sun's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
decline from the terrace. She was the happiest
creature breathing, till the day of their engagement
to Clanmoray.</p>

<p>And yet Christobelle fancied there were
symptoms of reserve on the part of her companion.
Conversation became, she thought, less
gaily free, less continuous. There were repeated
and long pauses, which she could not
break, and Sir John Spottiswoode appeared to
covet. They sat one morning in their rocky
seat, without exchanging a single word, till Sir
John suddenly exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is, indeed, perfect happiness."</p>

<p>Christobelle smiled.</p>

<p>"We are <i>silent</i> adorers of Nature; but our
feelings are not the less sincere."</p>

<p>"Powerful admiration is in the heart, not
upon the lips," replied her companion, sighing.</p>

<p>"Yet we admired the scene as fervently when
we chatted and sang upon the lake," observed
Christobelle.</p>

<p>"That was eye-service, Miss Wetheral. The
glorious scenery <i>then</i> delighted my eye, but had
not reached my heart; its effects now are very
soothing, yet melancholy."</p>

<p>"Don't let me interrupt your meditations,
then," Christobelle replied, with a little feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of offended pride, which had never risen in her
bosom till that moment. She was ashamed of
its existence, but it <i>would</i> display itself.</p>

<p>"I have not the sprightly and winning tongue
of Lord Farnborough, Miss Wetheral. I cannot
be witty and yet feel deeply."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough," replied Christobelle,
colouring, "was not in my thoughts."</p>

<p>"I spoke unadvisedly, my dear pupil: forgive
the stern schoolmaster."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode held out his hand, and
when did Christobelle resist that affectionate
title, which recalled his instructions, and their
happy days at Wetheral? She gave her own
hand with the delight of heart which every one
experiences who renews a happy intercourse
with half displeased friends. Sir John Spottiswoode
held it for some moments; and when
it was withdrawn gently from his grasp, they
again relapsed into silence. The dressing-bell
startled them from their long reverie.</p>

<p>"Oh, that tiresome bell!" exclaimed Christobelle,
"how dismally and faithfully it summons
one from mental enjoyment to the creature comforts!"</p>

<p>"It is wisely ordered!" replied Sir John
Spottiswoode, placing her arm within his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
"I will tell you why I judge it so, as we climb
this steep. We enjoy all things by comparison,
and in their variety. Mental pleasures depend
upon calm bodily tranquillity; and where the
constitution suffers, there is little leisure for
the mind to absorb itself in its own reveries.
There! you have slipped, and hurt your foot!"</p>

<p>"But the dressing-bell&mdash;you have not yet
illustrated your position!" exclaimed Christobelle,
in some confusion, as her companion
caught her fall, by throwing his arm round
her waist, though it was instantly withdrawn.</p>

<p>"I was going to enter upon it as you fell, my
argumentative pupil. A calm mind depends
upon bodily repose, which demands support,
which is effected by food, which is denoted by
the dressing-bell to be preparing. Have I not
stated it truly and concisely."</p>

<p>"Yes; a perfect 'House that Jack built,'
in its tripping measure. You will rival Lord
Farnborough."</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this extraordinary
arrangement, that all the ladies are to sail in
one vessel, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"Miss Ponsonby's whim, I believe. I look
forward with pleasure to our party to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes: I feel light as the heather-bell, and
quite ready to aim poisoned arrows at Lord
Farnborough. Will it amuse you?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly."</p>

<p>"You do not like Lord Farnborough?"</p>

<p>"I have no reason to feel entertainment in
his lordship's society. I am not an admirer of
his conversation."</p>

<p>Christobelle thought Sir John Spottiswoode
spoke a little bitterly of poor Lord Farnborough,
but it did not surprise her. Doubtless, Mr. Beverly's
supposed injury had taken effect upon
his friend's mind, and prejudiced him against
his lordship. Christobelle did not, however,
continue a subject in itself uninteresting. Lord
Farnborough had no charm for her; she only
felt amused by his sprightly powers. While
her father and Sir John Spottiswoode were near,
Christobelle's spirits ever rose into gaiety: she
would be gaiety itself during the water excursion,
and Sir John would be gay too, only
he spoke so deprecatingly of the affair. They
did not linger on the terrace. Christobelle had
only time to promise her companion that the
evening should be devoted to music, and she
hurried to her room. The second bell sounded
ere she could reach the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning rose in sunny smiles.
A mist had cleared away, leaving the sparkling
waters of the lake bright and clear; and Christobelle's
spirits were unusually high at the prospect
of her happy day of pleasurable anticipation.
She spoke in metaphor, and thought in
rhyme; but her astonishment was great, in
beholding the coolness of Sir John Spottiswoode's
manner, and viewing the gravity of his
countenance at breakfast. Christobelle's most
lively sallies passed perfectly unnoticed and unheeded.
She could not win one smile, or obtain
one remark from her friend. His eye appeared
heavy, and Christobelle fancied he must suffer
from concealed illness, otherwise he would have
caught the infection of her spirits. The thought
of Sir John Spottiswoode suffering sobered her
vivacity. She became grave, and gradually
even sad, to witness his dejection. Christobelle
approached him when they rose from the breakfast-table;
her mother had quitted the breakfast-room,
and she feared no misconstruction of her
anxiety.</p>

<p>"I know you are ill. I am sure you are
unfit to join a party full of mirth."</p>

<p>"I believe I am unequal to this morning's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
gaiety; certainly quite unfitted for mirth," was
the dejected answer.</p>

<p>"How very annoying that it should take
place to-day; or how provoking that you should
ever be ill! Did you rise unwell?"</p>

<p>"No; I was perfectly well when I entered
the breakfast-room; but a few turns on the
terrace with Lady Wetheral, before you appeared,
has caused a head and heart ache. I
cannot remain at Fairlee solitary, but I am too
ill to mix in a party of pleasure."</p>

<p>"I wish we were both going in our own boat,
to our own island, to be quiet," Christobelle exclaimed.
"I do not enjoy large parties when
my friends are ill."</p>

<p>"You will not observe my sickness of heart,
Miss Wetheral. You will be gaily engaged."</p>

<p>"Not if you are ill."</p>

<p>Christobelle was not aware of the compliment
conveyed in her observation. She spoke from
her heart simply and sincerely, without considering
its flattering tendency. Sir John Spottiswoode
caught her hand, and released it again
suddenly. He turned abruptly away.</p>

<p>"Do not speak so recklessly, so heartlessly,
I beseech you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never was suspected of heartlessness, Sir
John Spottiswoode!"</p>

<p>Christobelle also turned away, for proud tears
rose at the unexpected attack. She was quitting
the room.</p>

<p>"Stay one moment, and say you forgive me,"
he cried with energy. "Forgive me, Miss
Wetheral&mdash;forgive me, my generous pupil!"</p>

<p>Christobelle turned at the last expression,
and her emotion was apparent, for he caught
her in his arms.</p>

<p>"I cannot support this sight! What right
had I to presume to give pain! What right had
I to breathe a harsh expression towards a creature
all heart, and all nobleness!"</p>

<p>"I am not angry," she replied, withdrawing
from his embrace&mdash;"I am not angry, Sir John
Spottiswoode; only I do not deserve the appellation
of heartless. I spoke in sincerity and
truth."</p>

<p>"I know you did. I was wrong to speak as
I did&mdash;forgive me!"</p>

<p>"I do forgive you," she answered, smiling,
and another long pressure of the hand attested
their reconciliation.</p>

<p>"Calm a penitent spirit by a stroll on the
terrace, and talk to me, that I may forget my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fault and its cause. Let me hear your voice
again, and let me hear it till Lord Farnborough
arrives."</p>

<p>The friends walked nearly an hour together.
Christobelle's spirits were again elevated, and
she chatted with renewed vivacity. Sir John
Spottiswoode walked smilingly by her side,
listening to her anticipations of his illness dispersing
in the fresh air of Lochleven; but he
was not himself. He replied to her remarks,
and lent his powers in playful conversation; but
they were not <i>given</i>. He often sighed, and
repeatedly compelled his companion to bespeak
his attention.</p>

<p>"You tell me to chat, and your mind is far
away," she said, at last, weary with receiving
no reply.</p>

<p>"But I have not lost a word. I hear you
with the most vivid attention, because you will
not long honour me."</p>

<p>"Why so, I pray you, gentle coz?"</p>

<p>"You will be engrossed by Lord Farnborough!"</p>

<p>"That, then, will be your own fault!"</p>

<p>He looked earnestly in Christobelle's face, and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Say it once more, my pupil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be your own fault, if <i>any one</i> engrosses
my attention. Why should I be inattentive
to my naughty schoolmaster?"</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough bounded from the drawing-room
window upon the terrace, and advanced
towards them. Christobelle felt her companion's
arm relax; she looked reproachingly towards him.</p>

<p>"You wish already to get rid of your poor
pupil?"</p>

<p>"Never, never!" was the subdued reply; but
Lord Farnborough stood before them.</p>

<p>"You are ready, I see. Is not this a glorious
day? Clanmoray is in a proper bustle, and the
lake never looked so beautiful. Miss Ponsonby
declares she will be the 'Lady of the Lake,' and
dress in costume as you do, Miss Wetheral.
She hopes some 'Malcolm' of Lochleven will start
forth and woo her, but she rather despairs of
such good fortune. Malcolm will be attracted
elsewhere."</p>

<p>A low bow from his lordship pointed the
compliment, and Christobelle curtseyed to its
meaning. Sir John Spottiswoode would not
enter into the unmeaning dialogue which succeeded:
he pertinaciously avoided even lending
a smile to Lord Farnborough. How deeply he
resented, in Christobelle's eyes, the offence offered
to his friend Beverly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a beautiful drive to Clanmoray. Lady
Wetheral, forgetful of her long confinement&mdash;her
nervous feelings&mdash;and the painful remembrance
of Clara's death, chatted through the
carriage-window with Lord Farnborough, as
gaily and as sportively as ever. Christobelle
amused herself with rallying Sir John Spottiswoode
upon his illness, which she assured him
was affected, to try the sympathy of his friends.
He rebutted the idea with excellent good
humour, and they entered the grounds of General
Ponsonby in most merry mood.</p>

<p>Two or three groupes were seated in picturesque
attitudes, listening to Captain Ponsonby,
who struck a guitar with great spirit,
and amused the company with Spanish Boleros
and Moorish songs. The Wetherals' arrival was
the signal to embark; and, in the confusion of
introductions, reception, compliments, decisions
upon the fit and unfit, and Miss Ponsonby's determination
to be the Lady of the Lake, Christobelle
found herself descending the wooded hill
which sloped to the waters' edge, escorted by
Lord Farnborough and Mr. Ponsonby. Lady
Wetheral followed closely upon her daughter's
steps, leaning upon the arm of the Duke of
Forfar. Christobelle cast lingering looks at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
groupe which dotted the pathway, but she
could not distinguish the figure of Sir John
Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Well, we look neat, however," said Mr.
Ponsonby, cracking a whip, which never departed
from his right hand.</p>

<p>"Is my father near, Mr. Ponsonby?" Christobelle
asked, anxiously. She was sure Sir John
Spottiswoode would be near <i>him</i>, and her heart
wished to ascertain his movements. She dared
not appear interested in the whereabout of
her "tutor," to attract notice. Mr. Ponsonby
cracked his whip, and looked behind him.</p>

<p>"Sir John Wetheral and your friend are
escorting my sisters. Do observe the pretty
effect of the groupe descending the glen."</p>

<p>They turned to admire the picturesque figures
which adorned the woody scene. Lady Wetheral
also lingered with his Grace of Forfar,
to gaze upon their effect.</p>

<p>"These scenes are not to be found in Shropshire,"
observed his Grace. "The Wrekin lying
upon the plain, like a whale in a dish, will be
tame work when we can remember Lochleven."</p>

<p>"And yet I sometimes sigh for the scenes
I have quitted," said her ladyship. "I confess
I love the busy hum of man, and Lochleven is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dreary in the winter months. I wish I could
persuade my daughter she is dull at Fairlee."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral loves the grand seclusion of
Lochleven, because her taste has not been
vitiated by society."</p>

<p>"My daughter is wedded to calm life, and
loves no agitation beyond the ruffled lake. I
believe her spirit would pine in the gay world."</p>

<p>"So much the better, my good lady; her
young mind is uncontaminated by the arts of
a worldly life."</p>

<p>"My endeavour is to preserve its purity, and
watch over its happiness," replied her ladyship,
sighing.</p>

<p>At this moment the whole party became
united again. Sir John Spottiswoode quitted
Miss Fanny Ponsonby, and approached Christobelle.
Lady Wetheral perceived the movement,
and she turned hastily round.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you are tired, you look pale.
My lord, you have outwalked even your 'genius
of the Lake.'"</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough offered his arm, with many
polite regrets. Christobelle declined it, courteously.
She was quite equal to the walk;&mdash;she
felt no fatigues.</p>

<p>"Oblige me, my dear child," said Lady Wetheral,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
anxiously; "I cannot be satisfied unless
you accept his lordship's assistance. My dear
girl, make me happy."</p>

<p>Christobelle could hesitate no longer. All
eyes were upon her; she was actually in the
way, and a remark from his Grace confused her.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, you stand there, turning
all the young men's heads. Harry, take
away your prize, for we are at fault till you
proceed."</p>

<p>Christobelle was led away, accordingly; and
she saw no more of Sir John Spottiswoode, till
they gained the shore of the lake. He was
walking still with Miss Fanny Ponsonby, when
she beheld him again. He was apparently explaining
something to her comprehension, for
she was leaning upon his arm, and he was pointing
to the peak of Cona. Was he quoting Ossian
to the beautiful Fanny Ponsonby, regardless
of the party, and of the friend who would
have listened so gladly? Did he mean to become
the partner of Fanny Ponsonby, when he
told her, in their early walk, that he should hear
her own voice only on the terrace?&mdash;when he told
her, <i>she</i> would be appropriated by Lord Farnborough?
A pang of jealousy pierced her heart at
the moment, indescribably bitter; it was a pang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
closed her eyes, and pressed her hand tightly
upon her heart. The movement attracted the
notice of Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>"I fear you are ill, indeed, Miss Wetheral.
I am sure you have found the descent very
fatiguing."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> rather ill," exclaimed Christobelle,
still keeping her eyes closed. She could not
endure the light, or the figures which flitted before
her. She felt extremely giddy; so much
so, she was apprehensive of falling. An exclamation
from her companion caught the ear of
Lady Wetheral, who was immediately at her
daughter's side. Christobelle was placed upon
a bank, and she leaned against her mother's
shoulder. She waved away the gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Let no one come near me, mamma. Let no
one speak to me, just now."</p>

<p>The duke and his lordship politely retreated.
Lady Wetheral bestowed her sweetest smile upon
her daughter, but it was not seen; and it would
have added only to Christobelle's disquiet, if it
had met her eye. Her ladyship was very soothing.</p>

<p>"No one shall distress you, Bell; but if, as
I suspect, Lord Farnborough has spoken to you
rather warmly, you must accustom yourself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
this sort of thing. Only silly girls are overpowered
by a love-speech or two;&mdash;do collect
yourself, my love, and avoid attracting notice.
This is all as it should be, but collect yourself."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough has not&mdash;" Christobelle
could not proceed: she felt gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"Of course not, my dear Bell. A symphony
precedes an air&mdash;every thing will steal on in
proper order. Rouse yourself. Your father is
coming to us&mdash;do not appear girlish."</p>

<p>Her father's presence and touch revived the
spirit of Christobelle. She rose, and leaned
upon his arm; she felt better when her father
was near her. She entreated to be allowed to
walk with <i>him</i>&mdash;to be with him on the water
and on land. She should be quite well and
happy, quite composed, if she walked only with
<i>him</i>&mdash;with her father.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, do not shock me by any display
of folly. Lord Farnborough is lingering
near us&mdash;resume his assistance, and let us rejoin
the company. We are detaining them on
the shore." Lady Wetheral rose, as she spoke,
with great composure, but a smile of pleasure
lurked beneath her grave and calm expression
of countenance. How greatly was she mistaken
in the cause of her daughter's emotion!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall be my companion, Chrystal," said
her father, drawing his daughter's arm within
his, "and I will take charge of you. We will
not delay the party."</p>

<p>This was not quite in the fitness of things.
Her ladyship was discomposed.</p>

<p>"But, my love, Lord Farnborough will have
every reason to feel offended: it wears a very extraordinary
appearance that his lordship should
be so suddenly deserted. My dear Bell, you
cannot altogether desert your companion."</p>

<p>"A father's care will not give umbrage to
any gentleman, Gertrude. I will attend to my
daughter, since she requests it. No one will
plead desertion when I am in question."</p>

<p>This step discomposed her ladyship's "arrangements,"
but impediments only roused her
mind, and found employment for her energies.
All the resources of her genius were brought
into full operation by this unfortunate occurrence;
and never, in Christobelle's earliest days,
did she remember her mother more present to
herself&mdash;more fitted to contend with the exigencies
of the moment. Lord Farnborough joined
them as they proceeded towards the lake. Miss
Ponsonby flew towards Christobelle, at the same
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, I would not intrude while you
were under such proper protection, but I hope
you are recovered. What was it?&mdash;a little
megrim?"</p>

<p>"We have forgotten its proper designation,
and even its existence," replied Lady Wetheral,
smilingly; "I am only anxious my daughter
should not undertake too much fatigue. I fear
her efforts in trying to promote amusement for
our guest, Sir John Spottiswoode, have overcome
her strength."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral shall not suffer from efforts of
any kind this morning. My lord, take possession
of your fair cargo, but reserve the seat of
honour for our young friend."</p>

<p>Christobelle clung to her father's arm, but
Miss Ponsonby did not observe the movement.</p>

<p>"Sir John Wetheral, you are my property;
you must relinquish your fair daughter."</p>

<p>"Are we not admissable together, Miss Ponsonby?"</p>

<p>"I will have no rival&mdash;yes, I change my mind;
I will have Miss Wetheral for my Eucharis, and
be myself Calypso, instead of Ellen Douglas.
Where shall I find a Telemachus?"</p>

<p>"Sir John Spottiswoode," answered Lord
Farnborough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I hate a flirting Telemachus&mdash;he is saying
sugared sentences to Fanny."</p>

<p>"Mortimer Grey," rejoined his lordship.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Telemachus with a hare-lip?&mdash;now,
out upon you! Miss Wetheral, you are
mine, and you are Eucharis. I steal you from
my lord."</p>

<p>"I cannot resign my fair assignment&mdash;racks
and tortures shall not extort my consent," replied
Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby came up.</p>

<p>"What are we waiting for? Your boat is
filling, Mary&mdash;we must not delay. Miss Wetheral,
are you of our party? allow me to lead
you to the boat."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral is mine," cried Lord Farnborough,
"and I give her to no mortal."</p>

<p>"It is a freight worth contending for, Farnborough:
state your claims."</p>

<p>"The lady's own fair word, Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"I will hear it from her own lips. Miss Wetheral,
Genius of the Lake, as they truly style
you...."</p>

<p>"I dispute the title," exclaimed Miss Ponsonby.
"I have also adopted the costume, and
I choose to share the distinction."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate Mary!&mdash;name fatal to peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
upon Lochleven, be still. Does Miss Wetheral
consign herself wholly and solely to Lord Farnborough?"</p>

<p>"I wish to go with my father," eagerly replied
Christobelle.</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough bowed proudly and coldly.
Captain Ponsonby waved his hat in the air.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Miss Wetheral and independence!
For once, my lord, you are refused&mdash;checked in
your high careering. Miss Wetheral, will you
give your fair hand to a portionless son?"</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby held out his arm to escort
her to his vessel, but Christobelle's hand was
taken gently yet firmly by her mother.</p>

<p>"My dear daughter thanks you, gentlemen,
for your polite and amusingly-agreeable knight-errantry.
Captain Ponsonby, however, is only
unsuccessful from being too late. I believe
honour is a treasure too delicate to endure a
breath of reproach, and we are pledged to my
Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"Then, 'soft ideas fly,'" said Captain Ponsonby,
laying his hand upon his heart.</p>

<p>"'See our oars with feathered spray,'" exclaimed
Miss Ponsonby. "We must stay here no
longer. I must not be Calypso&mdash;fair Eucharis
is taken from me. I believe I had better remain
only Mary Ponsonby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your sound judgment soon crushes imagination,"
cried her brother. "As Mary Ponsonby,
you are a good-tempered, noisy kind of
girl&mdash;but Calypso, or Ellen Douglas, would
prove a failure."</p>

<p>"No lack of mentor, however," observed Miss
Ponsonby, as she nodded her adieus, and took
possession of Sir John Wetheral's arm. Captain
Ponsonby called after her.</p>

<p>"Mary, I am going to take charge of Lady
Wetheral. Tell Mortimer Grey, to take my
place."</p>

<p>"But your party will lose such a dominant
spirit, my dear Captain Ponsonby," said her
ladyship, as Miss Ponsonby waved her hand, in
token of assent.</p>

<p>"Disappointment is the lot of mortality,"
replied Captain Ponsonby, gaily&mdash;"I cannot
divide myself into two, and my heart is with
<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>The party was soon launched upon the lake.
Captain Ponsonby insisted upon taking his station
between Lady Wetheral and her daughter,
and his gay spirits almost whiled Christobelle into
cheerfulness. She saw Sir John Spottiswoode
enter the first boat with Miss Fanny Ponsonby,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
but he never turned to cast a glance towards
Christobelle&mdash;never once came forward to say
he hoped she was well and happy. Her heart
swelled with sorrow so poignant, that she heeded
not Lord Farnborough's anxious arrangements
to make her comfortable&mdash;his efforts to secure
her from the breeze which rose upon the water.
She heeded nothing&mdash;cared for nothing. Miss
Fanny Ponsonby might consider the excursion a
party of deep delight, and Lochleven might be to
her a remembrance of pleasurable things&mdash;but
Christobelle felt the whole affair a mockery.
Her mother endeavoured to arouse her faculties.</p>

<p>"My love, Lord Farnborough has spoken
twice&mdash;his lordship hopes you feel no inconvenience
from the sun?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am very comfortable."</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, you are not aware Lord Farnborough
has placed his cloak under your feet."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," whispered her ladyship,
"throw off the girl, and be a woman of dignified,
composed manners."</p>

<p>"I wish I was any thing but what I am,
mamma."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; not one of your sisters acted so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
girlishly. I beg you will consider my shocked
feelings."</p>

<p>Christobelle did make an effort to shake off
the bonds which seemed to bind her spirits with
links of iron. She turned from the contemplation
of Sir John Spottiswoode and Fanny
Ponsonby, but they rose before her like the undying
Hydra. She saw them, in imagination,
engaged in agreeable conversation&mdash;the beautiful
eyes of Fanny Ponsonby fixed upon her companion's
face, and her mind informed by his
remarks. Christobelle saw him, in fancy, fascinated
by her loveliness&mdash;eager to please&mdash;absorbed&mdash;forgetful
of their own pleasant walks
together&mdash;their readings&mdash;their long and happy
pauses on the terrace, watching the last beams
of the summer sun. She started with terror.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, you are not alarmed?" exclaimed
her mother. "Lord Farnborough is
kind enough to take the helm."</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby smiled. "What! the Genius
of the Lake alarmed upon her own element?
Forbid it, storms and clouds!"</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, you would feel more undisturbed
if you were at my <i>left</i> hand," whispered
Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Miss Wetheral would deceive herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
if she looked for rest near <i>you</i>, Farnborough:
I will not part with my supporters. Miss Wetheral,
do not be inveigled away from me. No
whispering, unless it is allowed to all, if you
please."</p>

<p>"You were pointing north this morning,
Ponsonby; and now the wind sits easterly."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"East, west&mdash;alas! I care not whither,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So thou art safe, and I with thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>exclaimed Captain Ponsonby, turning towards
Christobelle, with a smile.</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough became silent and sullen.
A deep gloom spread over his handsome face,
and its bland expression faded. Lord Farnborough
wore a countenance, which Christobelle
could never have recognised as the agreeable set
of features which first pleased her at Lochleven.
His lordship turned with indignant pride from
his friend, and gave his attention to the Miss
Quintins.</p>

<p>"Bell!" whispered Lady Wetheral, as Captain
Ponsonby again stooped forward, to adjust
his cloak, "you will lose him."</p>

<p>"Lose him!" thought Christobelle&mdash;"yes, I
have lost him&mdash;for is he not uttering 'sugared
sentences' to Fanny Ponsonby?&mdash;and is he not
regardless of his old acquaintance? How easy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it is to sit in happy, careless tranquillity, when
no cloud veils our hopes! How happy was I,
till the Clanmoray party broke through the
seclusion of Fairlee, and brought a Fanny Ponsonby
between me and my peace! How happy
was I in my freedom, roving amid the groves of
Fairlee, before Sir John Spottiswoode arrived, to
teach me the glow of friendship, and then to
withdraw its light!" Ill, unhappy, and indifferent
to the scenery, which was her former
object of devotion, Christobelle heeded not the
sullen silence of Lord Farnborough, or the fears
of her mother. The little attention she could
spare from the conjurations of her wretched
fancy, Christobelle gave to the gay and kind-hearted
Ponsonby.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p>"Miss Wetheral," said Captain Ponsonby,
"when I quitted Clanmoray, six years ago, I
never dreamed of a fair neighbour at Fairlee."</p>

<p>"Six years ago I was nursing a doll, Captain
Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"Even so. You tease your dolls in youth,
and tease our hearts in age. Like a falling star,
you have shot from your sphere, upon the banks
of this lake, and where shall you make your
rest?"</p>

<p>"You have been some time in Ireland, Captain
Ponsonby, and have caught the true hyperbole."</p>

<p>"I had no practice there, Miss Wetheral. If
I told a lady she was charming, it was 'ah now,
you're joking'&mdash;and if I advanced with classical
allusions, or sparkling metaphor, it was 'ah now,
Captain Ponsonby, you're so droll!'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Irish ladies possibly guessed your character,
Captain Ponsonby, as it appears to have
been a general answer. They knew you were
either in jest, or sarcastic."</p>

<p>"Upon my honour, you are wrong. I am
sincere in word and deed. I am neither fair nor
false, the motto of some of my neighbours.
Don't look this way, Farnborough."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral," said his lordship, "do not
believe half you hear from Ponsonby's lips."</p>

<p>"It hit my lord hard, you perceive, Miss
Wetheral."</p>

<p>"My friend Ponsonby is a rover&mdash;sans eyes,
sans heart, sans every thing, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"Excellent&mdash;ha, ha!" laughed Captain Ponsonby.
"I can disprove the charge, Miss Wetheral.
I was in love three whole days, once, at
Castlebar."</p>

<p>"And why so speedy a cure?" Christobelle
demanded.</p>

<p>"The lady kept silence three days," he replied,
"but, on the fourth morning, the charm
dissolved, for she spoke."</p>

<p>"What could she have spoken, to break a
spell so powerful, Captain Ponsonby?"</p>

<p>"I met the lady in a pouring rain, and,
though I had not been introduced to her, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had met often, and were acquainted by name
and sight. I offered her my escort and my umbrella.
'Ah, now, Captain Ponsonby, there's
rason in what you say, and I'll be obleeged to
you'&mdash;was her good-humoured reply. I could
bear the brogue tolerably, Miss Wetheral, for
six months' residence had enured me to its
twang; but I could not away with the perfect
nonchalance with which she exhibited a pair of
enormous ancles, and appealed to me upon their
use. 'Ah now, Captain Ponsonby, if I've got
no understanding above, there's plenty below,
and I'll be charged for two pair of legs through
the penny turnpikes.' Farewell the glowing
complexion and bright eyes of my love!&mdash;I
never more gazed upon Miss M'Nab."</p>

<p>"Was that your <i>only</i> enlargement of heart,
Captain Ponsonby?"</p>

<p>"Some few relapses there might have been,
but none of any consideration. Miss M'Nab
was the most serious love."</p>

<p>"You are difficult to please."</p>

<p>"No, I think not; but I desire to find a sufficiently
lovely woman, with sweetness of temper,
and delicacy of manners, to love with constancy.
If I ever love sincerely, it will be my
life-strings&mdash;the very breath of my life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then be very cautious, Captain Ponsonby,"
said Christobelle, with a feeling of painful interest.
She felt how sorrowful were the disappointments
of friendship. What would the pangs
of unrequited affection be?</p>

<p>"Will you be my guardian angel, and watch
over me, Miss Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"I cannot undertake such a momentous
charge," she replied. Lord Farnborough watched
the conversation in gloomy silence, and conversed
no more with Miss Quintin. Lady Wetheral
was gratified by the expression of jealousy
which darkened his lordship's fine face, for,
during the little bustle of debarkation, she
smiled, and hastily whispered&mdash;"Christobelle,
very well managed, my love; a little jealousy
is useful, but beware of giving <i>offence</i>."</p>

<p>"Mamma, you are quite mistaken, indeed
you are."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Bell; I am keenly watching and
deciding." Lord Farnborough offered his hand
to assist her transit at that moment, and the
subject was of course dropped. Captain Ponsonby
offered his hand to Miss Wetheral, and
they followed in succession: he placed her arm
within his own, as they touched the shore of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
little island. "Mind, you belong to me, Miss
Wetheral; I shall not relinquish you now."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough consigned Lady Wetheral
to his father's care, and immediately returned.
His lordship appeared offended at the disposition
of things.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, I am deputed by Lady Wetheral
to bring you to her: allow me&mdash;" Lord
Farnborough put forth his arm. Captain Ponsonby interfered.</p>

<p>"No one takes my guardian angel from me.
I will take charge of Miss Wetheral with equal
care. Miss Wetheral is mine."</p>

<p>"My claim began earlier, Ponsonby," remarked
his lordship, with a look of fierceness.</p>

<p>"I will fight for every inch of mine. My
good fellow, the Quintins are unattended."</p>

<p>"My delegated place is by the side of Miss
Wetheral." Lord Farnborough threw a look of
defiance at her companion, which terrified Christobelle.
"Oh, pray take me to my father, Captain
Ponsonby," she cried; "pray let me walk
with my father."</p>

<p>"You shall be obeyed." Captain Ponsonby
drew her among the group, who were deciding
the plan of refreshment, or arranging their dress,
and gave her into her father's care; but Christobelle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
still dreaded the looks of Lord Farnborough.
She did not withdraw her arm from
Captain Ponsonby's support: he smiled.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> my guardian angel, after all. I see
your fears, and, while they operate to my advantage,
I hope they will continue. How delightful
it is to be the object of a woman's tender care!
every thing is so kindly and silently done."</p>

<p>"I do not like Lord Farnborough's looks,
Captain Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"Nor I, at all. I am very much alarmed,
and I beg you will keep near me." Christobelle
laughed.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral approached, leaning on the
arm of his Grace; and Lord Farnborough also
came up. Captain Ponsonby affected to tremble,
and assured Christobelle, if she quitted his protection,
he should be a lifeless corpse. He could
not bear the lightning of Lord Farnborough's
eye, or the thunder of his angry voice, at being
deprived of his prey. He thought they had
better contemplate the ruins of the little chapel,
while the party were quarrelling about the dinner-tables.
Sir John Wetheral was willing to
move, and Christobelle also was anxious to leave
the spot where Sir John Spottiswoode stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
pertinaciously by the side of Fanny Ponsonby.
Sickness of heart came over her, and she turned
from the scene.</p>

<p>Lochleven crowded all its beauties into the
panorama viewed from St. Mungo's Isle, but
Christobelle gazed upon them with vacancy:
her eye could not distinguish, and her mind
would not relish them. She sat upon a low,
ruined wall, in utter listlessness; and, in silence,
listened to Captain Ponsonby's statement of the
scenes which had taken place on the spot where
they rested, when it had been the sepulchre of
the clans of Glencoe and Lochaber. Christobelle's
adoration of ancient legends was sunk in
apathy. She dared not turn her head, lest the
fearful forms of Fanny Ponsonby and her companion
should startle her sight. She gazed on
the heights, without perceiving their beautiful
outline. She listened to Captain Ponsonby,
without the power of retaining his words. A
summons to the rural dinner alone roused her
spirits and energy.</p>

<p>"Bell, my love, I have preserved a seat for
you, near <i>me</i>," said Lady Wetheral, holding out
her hand&mdash;"Come to me, my love; you have
played truant."</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby seated Christobelle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
prepared to take possession of an empty chair
on her left hand, but Lady Wetheral smilingly
interfered&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear Captain Ponsonby, I believe your
seat belongs to another, but probably we can
make room for you. Ah! the benches interfere
so; but where will you find a seat? Spottiswoode,
is there not a vacant seat near you?"</p>

<p>"Do not disturb yourself, Lady Wetheral. I
am perfectly satisfied with my present quarters;
and when a turn out is beaten, I shall take a
sentinel's place."</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby accordingly seated himself,
and devoted his time and attention to the wants
of Christobelle, till Lord Farnborough joined
them, with a cold fowl upon his silver fork.</p>

<p>"I have been my rounds for a supply, and
can only gain one recruit, Lady Wetheral, a
fowl screened from observation by a bed of
parsley. Ponsonby, you'll excuse my resumption
of a seat which is mine by right of conquest."</p>

<p>"I only held it in fear and trembling, Farnborough.
I relinquish my seat with regret; but
if I must, I must. Miss Wetheral, pity my
sorrow, and admire my resolution." Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Ponsonby rose, and stationed himself behind her
chair.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, there are two seats at the
bottom of the table for you," said Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>"I am very happy in my present situation,"
replied Captain Ponsonby; "I am attending
upon Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"But the Greys are quite by themselves, Ponsonby;
do go down, and offer your services
there."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, you are wishing for a slice
of cold turkey; I saw you contemplating it," observed
Captain Ponsonby, who took no notice of
his friend's speech. "I fly for it."</p>

<p>"I wish Ponsonby would attend to the Greys,"
said his lordship, as Captain Ponsonby quitted
his station. "I shall be most happy to attend
upon you and Miss Quintin."</p>

<p>The eyes of Christobelle were riveted in the
direction of the turkey, as Captain Ponsonby remarked;
for there sat Sir John Spottiswoode,
and Fanny Ponsonby was at his side: she tried
to withdraw her eyes, but they were fixed by
leaden weights, and she gazed on. She saw
Sir John Spottiswoode turn to ask Captain Ponsonby
whom he should assist to a slice of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
breast; and when Miss Wetheral's name was
mentioned, he did not look towards her; he
turned and spoke to Fanny Ponsonby. Christobelle
would not allow the tears to rush from
their fountains, or a sigh to escape from her
heart, however pained were her feelings. She
only resolved never again to walk as she had
done with Sir John Spottiswoode, never again to
feel for him those kind and friendly sentiments
which he knew not how to appreciate. Captain
Ponsonby returned laughing from his mission.</p>

<p>"I wish you could hear Fanny and your handsome
friend, Miss Wetheral. They are trying
which shall make the most glaring compliment
to each other. I left your friend talking about
the heart of a lover, which made Fanny grave.
Do look at her, now." Christobelle glanced towards
his sister; her sprightly countenance had
faded into deep attention, as Sir John Spottiswoode
spoke earnestly; her glowing complexion
had changed its bloom, and was become pale.
Christobelle would have given worlds to have
been acquainted with their subject.</p>

<p>"Ponsonby, you are devilish rude; no one
has taken wine with the Greys," exclaimed Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Farnborough, as his friend resumed his station
behind the chair of Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Ponsonby," cried Mr. Grey, "are you under
orders there, that you stand sentinel over Miss
Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"I wish the guard was relieved, Grey," said
Lord Farnborough. "Beg your sisters to send
a deputation to Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"They would prefer your lordship," answered
Mr. Grey. "I speak in their names, because
they decline the publicity of confession."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough's countenance again became
gloomy, but he made no reply to Mr.
Grey. His lordship turned to Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, allow me the pleasure of
drinking wine with you."</p>

<p>Christobelle was happy to do so, and by that
action she gratified her mother, who sat by
her, proudly happy to witness his lordship's
vexation at the conduct of Captain Ponsonby.
Every one appeared happy but Christobelle: she
saw every face decked with smiles, and each
person appeared contented with the merriment
of the scene. She alone sat ill at ease, and received
no satisfaction in the attentions of Lord
Farnborough and his friend. She wished to be
silent and alone: she wished to think over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
events of the morning, and reckon with her
heart. She wished to ascertain if her disquietude
arose from unrequited friendship, or whether
she indeed loved Sir John Spottiswoode. The
noble friendships which Christobelle had contemplated
in history, teemed with grand and inspiring
actions, but she read not of eyes turned
away from the object, or misery created through
jealous misgivings. If she loved Sir John Spottiswoode,
what would become of her, should another
engross his attention and his heart? While
she was lingering with him among the cliffs of
the Lochleven, all was so tranquil, so happy, so
calmly and fearlessly happy! Why was it not
so with her in this gay group?</p>

<p>Christobelle was lost to all sound, till a general
move was made. The tables were abandoned
to the attendants, and the party retired to
the extremity of the little island, to amuse themselves
till the boats were again loaded with the
spoil of the entertainment. Christobelle was
attended by Lord Farnborough and Captain
Ponsonby, who appeared tacitly determined to
struggle for her attention, and annoy each other.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral," said his lordship, "you
will honour me by accepting my arm <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral cannot desert her old companion,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
remarked Captain Ponsonby, again
stepping forward and taking her hand; but Christobelle
withdrew it.</p>

<p>"I should like to understand your claims to
Miss Wetheral's notice, Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my good fellow. A lady possesses
her own right to select and approve."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand, Miss Wetheral, that
Captain Ponsonby is selected by you?"</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough spoke with a bitter sneer,
and stood before Christobelle with a raised complexion,
awaiting her answer. She was fearful
of unpleasant scenes; she wished to avoid
notice: she could only decide not to receive
assistance from either gentlemen. They however
walked on either side of her, and the
trio silently mixed among the retiring group.
Sir John Wetheral relieved his daughter's
perilous situation by his approach. Lord Farnborough
might conceal much beneath the restraint
of polished society; but his temper was
strongly irritable; it glistened in his eye, and
fired his countenance, whenever Captain Ponsonby
addressed Christobelle. The company
formed into little parties, on a green bank which
swelled towards the water's edge; and, by some
unseen chance, Christobelle was grouped in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
little knot which contained Sir John Spottiswoode.
Their eyes had not met since they
quitted Clanmoray. Captain Ponsonby and his
guest were crouched at her feet, her father sat
beside her, and Mr. Grey, with the Miss Ponsonbys,
completed the number. The rest of the
party sat only a few paces apart, but they were
engaged in different subjects of conversation,
and did not unite with them.</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby requested his sister Fanny
to enlighten the company upon the interesting
conversation which had taken place between
herself and her companion at dinner.</p>

<p>"It is vain to say," he continued, "that the
subject is forgotten, for I left you discoursing
upon a lover's heart; and your face, Fanny, was
so full of interest, I was obliged to bespeak Miss
Wetheral's attention."</p>

<p>Fanny Ponsonby coloured, but disclaimed
any peculiar interest in the subject. Her eyes
sought the ground, and Christobelle fancied they
filled with tears. Her sister begged to be heard
a few moments upon the subject. She was
rather inspired by the dinner, the party, and
the beautiful scenery, and she ventured to think
she could define a lover's heart, if her audience
were inclined to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence in the court!" exclaimed Lord Farnborough.
"The deponent speaks."</p>

<p>"A lover's heart," resumed Miss Ponsonby,
waving her hand, "is ennobled by affection,
grand in its conceptions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There you are out, Mary," cried her brother;
"on the very threshold you have stumbled. What
is a more jealous, narrowed, dull, complaining
concern than love, and a lover's heart? Can
any thing be more disturbing, distrustful, and
moody, or more capricious?"</p>

<p>"Speak on, Arthur; I know very little about
the matter, I believe, while your long absence
has doubtless taught you knowledge," cried Miss
Ponsonby.</p>

<p>"Does not love create suspicion?"&mdash;Christobelle
cast her eyes involuntarily towards Sir
John Spottiswoode, and met his fixed, melancholy
look. His eye was instantly withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Does not love create melancholy?" continued
Captain Ponsonby, turning to Christobelle,
"does it not produce the desire to please,
while it restrains the ability, Farnborough?
Does it not bow down the head, and make pale
the cheek, Fanny?"</p>

<p>Fanny Ponsonby started at her brother's address,
but she smiled good-humouredly at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
question. Her head had bent forward, and her
attention was earnestly given to the definition
of the lover's heart. Her attitude had attracted
the notice of her lively brother, and drawn down
his remark, but its purport was received as
gently, as its intention to give offence was innocent.
Not so Lord Farnborough. He rose
proudly from the humble position he had assumed,
and retired to the group detached from
his party. Captain Ponsonby continued his
remarks, while a satisfied smile played on his
lips.</p>

<p>"Altogether, love deforms and beautifies; it
makes the humble and silent man talkative; and
it causes the violent man to throw off the mask
which veils his fiery spirit. The less we know
of the subtle deity, the happier we are in freedom
of heart and spirit; but once receive him
to your bosom, and adieu for ever to the calm
pleasures of life."</p>

<p>"I thought, Arthur, 'love was heaven, and
heaven was love;' at least, that is my idea of the
passion."</p>

<p>"Mary!" exclaimed her brother, "presume
not to touch upon ground where your foot has
never yet trod. Be wise, and remain in your
ignorance, uninteresting, and uninformed. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
can be no heaven in the dire suspense, the conscious
feeling, the fear of scorn, the unrequited
pang, the jealous agony of heart, the sighs of
uncertainty."</p>

<p>Fanny Ponsonby rose hastily from her verdant
seat, and Sir John Spottiswoode accompanied her,
but they moved in different directions, when
they reached the site of the chapel which once
stood in this island, a place of worship for the
living, and an asylum for the dead. Fanny Ponsonby
appeared to seek refuge in solitary contemplation;
for she sought the most distant spot,
and stood gazing upon the lake. Sir John Spottiswoode
remained among the relics of the dead,
and seated himself on the low wall where Christobelle
had listened to Captain Ponsonby's legendary
tales in listless indifference.</p>

<p>"In general," said Captain Ponsonby, "an
orator draws an audience by his powers of speaking,
but I have chased mine into every corner of
this little earth. Either I have said too little
or too much. Mary and Mortimer are my best
supporters. Sir John Wetheral, you are considered
a veteran. Come, Miss Wetheral, let us
follow the multitude; it is vain to waste my
talent in empty space, so I dissolve the meeting."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby sprang to his feet, and the
little group gradually dispersed. Miss Ponsonby
declared her brother should have been
educated for the bar in lieu of the army, he held
forth so fluently upon unintelligible subjects;
and she challenged Mortimer Grey to assist her
in discovering the lost victims to Arthur's oratory.
They set forth in the direction of the
spot where Fanny Ponsonby still stood absorbed,
and alone. Captain Ponsonby walked chatting
by Christobelle, who leaned upon her father's
arm, and all bent their steps towards the little
ruined chapel.</p>

<p>"Who would have supposed so many graves,
heraldic devices, and rude sculpture, to lie forgotten
and deserted here?" said Captain Ponsonby,
pointing to the various relics of other
times which lay half buried in the earth around.
"How many stirring events have filled this soil
with mouldering bones, and caused the tears
to flow from maidens' eyes!"</p>

<p>"How many fearful feuds have made these
mountains echo with shouts and cries of blood!"
remarked Sir John Wetheral.</p>

<p>"Ay, but picture to your mind's eye the
funereal procession of the clans, slowly winding
down those bold cliffs in silent sorrow, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pibroch screamed its wild notes to wail the
dead." Captain Ponsonby's countenance assumed
a graver expression as he spoke, and
Christobelle thought it infinitely became the
cast of his features. It passed away quickly, as
they advanced towards Sir John Spottiswoode,
and he resumed his playful mood.</p>

<p>"Sir John Spottiswoode, Miss Wetheral
likens you to a lover bewailing his mistress."</p>

<p>"Pray, Captain Ponsonby, do not say so,"
exclaimed Christobelle, in alarm.</p>

<p>"You looked as if you thought so, Miss Wetheral.
Why is your eye so expressive?"</p>

<p>Christobelle felt distressed beyond measure
at Captain Ponsonby's thoughtless speech, which
elicited a cold smile from Sir John Spottiswoode.
How could he smile so coldly upon
her?</p>

<p>Christobelle had no spirits to reply to the
cheerful remarks of Captain Ponsonby, who
continued chatting with enviable ease of heart,
upon every subject which offered itself to his
notice. She was listening to a conversation infinitely
more attractive between her father and
Sir John Spottiswoode; but Captain Ponsonby's
vivacity perpetually interrupted her attention,
and called forth an unwilling and absent reply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
There is no annoyance so galling as the society
of the happy, when a heart is struggling with
grief, which seeks silence and solitude.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, I bespeak your attention to
those masses of clouds rising in the west; are
they not beautiful? Did you ever fancy forms
in the clouds? I do, often. See, Miss Wetheral,
I can outline a lion rampant perfectly in
that fleecy cloud&mdash;can you see it?"</p>

<p>Christobelle was disturbed: Sir John Spottiswoode
had spoken about Alverton, and she
wished to catch his words as they became indistinct.
She answered Captain Ponsonby hastily,
"No, indeed."</p>

<p>"I will point it out more distinctly. Fix
your eye upon the third dark cloud, and by the
side of that cloud stands the lion rampant. Now
do you see what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Christobelle, almost peevishly,
"I think I see what you mean." She trusted the
subject was now ended.</p>

<p>"Well, can you distinguish a chariot and
pair, Miss Wetheral? I see them distinctly,
and in excellent proportions."</p>

<p>"It pains my sight, Captain Ponsonby, to fix
my eyes upon the heavens."</p>

<p>"I will shade the light with my hat," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Captain Ponsonby; "there, now your eyes are
safe: the sun is behind my hat."</p>

<p>Christobelle was obliged to give her attention
to the indefatigable Captain Ponsonby, and she
lost all hope of Sir John Spottiswoode's remarks.
Her spirits were powerfully depressed; happily,
as the morning had opened upon her cheerful
expectations, every pleasant prospect was clouded
now. Sir John Spottiswoode had been gay and
playful in conversation, till they alighted at
Clanmoray, and from that moment her evil
genius had pursued her. Why was the companion
of her walks so changed, and why was he
so cold and silent to his friend?</p>

<p>It appeared to Christobelle that Sir John
Spottiswoode suffered under an equally potent
spell. The tone of his voice as he spoke to her
father was low and melancholy, and there was an
expression in his withdrawn eyes, which particularly
affected her. It was not of anger, he
was too kind to feel angry; it was not of irritability,
such as she had seen flashing and dull by
turns, in her mother's countenance. There was
an expression, touching and attractive in his
disquietude, which went at once to her heart,
and occupied its thoughts. She could ill endure
the rapid remarks and conversation of Captain
Ponsonby: how she wished to be again at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Fairlee, free from observation, and at liberty to
think upon all that had occurred, in the solitude
of her own apartment! Oh, that she had
never seen Fanny Ponsonby! It was Fanny
Ponsonby who pointed the arrow of jealousy at
her heart, and tore the veil from her eyes. It
was Fanny Ponsonby who taught her that friendship
was but a cloak for deeper feelings, and
that the pain she inflicted betrayed a heart
prostrate before that Deity whose arrows, under
a borrowed name, enter unsuspiciously into the
soul of his victim.</p>

<p>"But, Miss Wetheral, you are meditating too
gravely," resumed Captain Ponsonby, after a
pause of some minutes, "the tombs of a thousand
souls cause your eye to grow heavy. Let
us sing away care upon these swelling earths.
Where are the mirthful ones, and where are the
singing-men, and the singing-women? The
Greys are all musical."</p>

<p>The vivacious Captain Ponsonby called the
party round him, and they seated themselves on
the mounds which were scattered thickly round
the chapel. The Greys formed the centre of
the groupe, and their full voices wafted along
the waters that beautiful glee of Calcot's, "Desolate
is the dwelling of Morna." The effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was truly delicious. Desolate, indeed, was the
ground upon which they sat; and silent, indeed,
were the sounds which in former times burst from
the shores of Lochleven. The harmony and its
wildly poetic words accorded well with the scene
before and around them. "Yet, a few years, and
the blast of the desert comes," fell upon Christobelle's
ear, and roused a thousand emotions.</p>

<p>It seemed to describe in one short sentence
the tale of life; and it too truly illustrated her
own wretched position. She could not repress
the tears which flowed at the thought, that even
in her early youth, care was beginning to do its
work. She turned involuntarily to look upon
Fanny Ponsonby, the author of her wretchedness.
She was seated a little apart, and her
head had sunk upon her breast, as though the
harmonious sounds had lulled her into deep repose;
but Christobelle saw the heavings of her
bosom, and knew she wept.</p>

<p>The Greys concluded their song, and Captain
Ponsonby was called upon to lend his talents towards
the harmony of the scene. The young
officer was nothing loth: with inexpressible
softness, and in excellent taste, he sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There's something in that bonny face,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I never saw before, lassie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your actions a' have sic a grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I gaze and I adore, lassie."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby turned towards Christobelle,
as he concluded the last line of the first
stanza, and he pressed his hand gallantly upon
his heart, as he gave the last verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet is the spring, and sweet the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When moistened by the shower, lassie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright on the thorn the dew-drop glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At morns refulgent hour, lassie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But brighter, purer far than these<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou art, and charm'st me more, lassie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than tongue can tell; I wondering gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I gaze and I adore, lassie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Christobelle blushed deeply at the general notice
which Captain Ponsonby's manner attracted
towards her, and Lady Wetheral thought it
prudent to break up the party, lest the offended
countenance of Lord Farnborough should deepen,
and produce results in his conduct, which would
overthrow her dearest plans. She turned to
Miss Ponsonby.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Ponsonby, are not those
clouds threatening? I have observed them some
minutes with fearful forebodings: my dear Bell,
fold your plaid round you, the air is becoming
fresh."</p>

<p>The attention of the party was turned anxiously
to the west, and General Ponsonby advised
an immediate return to the opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the boatmen to their oars, and Lord Farnborough
took his vacant place by the side of
Christobelle. His lordship spoke with much
vehemence of manner.</p>

<p>"You have been bored with your neighbour,
Miss Wetheral, yet you have preferred him to
me."</p>

<p>"Captain Ponsonby did not weary me, my
lord."</p>

<p>"I hate those talking fellows, yet ladies love
to be attended by them. I can't think why all
ladies like Ponsonby to run after them."</p>

<p>Christobelle was offended by Lord Farnborough's
expressions. When his lordship attended
her from Lochleven Castle to Fairlee Cove, all
was courtesy and gallant bearing&mdash;but his lordship
had become overbearing, and, if she might
so express it, he was actually offensive in St.
Mungo's Isle. She made no reply.</p>

<p>"Allow me to take charge of you to the
shore, Miss Wetheral," continued his lordship.</p>

<p>Christobelle hesitated. "Captain Ponsonby,
I believe&mdash;I rather think...."</p>

<p>"Of course I must give way," replied his
lordship, drily, "of course every thing must
give way to Captain Ponsonby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby came up, to announce all
was in readiness; and the party rose to prepare
for departure. Lady Wetheral approached her
daughter.</p>

<p>"Bell, you are devoting yourself very publicly
to Captain Ponsonby. I intreat you to be
cautious, and accept Lord Farnborough's offer
of attendance."</p>

<p>"Mamma, I am offended with Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"Do not be silly, Miss Wetheral; this is not
the moment to exhibit offended feelings. I
wish you to walk with my lord, and return under
his charge."</p>

<p>Lady Anna Herbert passed, leaning on Mr.
Grey's arm. "Be quick, fair ladies, for there
is every chance of rain," she exclaimed; "the
boatmen prognosticate weather before we reach
the main land."</p>

<p>There was much bustle in hurrying into the
boats, and the wind rose suddenly, sweeping in
gusts over the lake, ere the party left the island.
Christobelle was hurried rapidly into the little
vessel, between Lord Farnborough and Captain
Ponsonby, and the rain began to descend in torrents,
as they placed her, in the confusion, between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Sir John Spottiswoode and Fanny Ponsonby.</p>

<p>"On, on, for your lives!" cried Captain Ponsonby,
addressing the boatmen, and the party
were launched upon the waters of Lochleven.</p>

<p>Christobelle was by the side of Sir John Spottiswoode,
and her mind was tranquil as they
rowed rapidly towards Clanmoray. He held an
umbrella over her head; and endeavoured to
guard her from the storm, by spreading his cloak
round her feet and knees. She felt distressed
and uncomfortable at the thought of his own exposure
to the rain and wind. She intreated him
to suffer her to return the cloak, without which
he must be cold and comfortless.</p>

<p>"No," he replied gravely, "I do not consider
my own feelings, I wish to secure your
comfort."</p>

<p>"But I have <i>no</i> comfort in depriving you of
warmth and shelter: you will catch a severe
cold."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Miss Wetheral; my mother and
Sophia will nurse me well at Alverton."</p>

<p>"At Alverton!" exclaimed Christobelle, in
astonishment, "at Alverton!"</p>

<p>"Why not, Miss Wetheral?" he asked in low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
tones, and his fine dark eyes were fixed upon
her with such deep expression!</p>

<p>"Oh, no, if you are ill, I will nurse you; and
Fairlee shall be your&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Christobelle stopped: her heart beat thickly&mdash;she
could not speak the conclusion of her sentence&mdash;a
weight, as of iron, bore down her eyelids,
and she remained silent.</p>

<p>"You have been happy to-day, my pupil?"
said Sir John Spottiswoode, after a moment's
pause.</p>

<p>Christobelle waved her hand silently. She
could not trust her voice; but Fanny Ponsonby
was talking to Lord Farnborough, and she was
wretched at the allusion to Alverton. Curiosity,
anxiety, and the horrors of suspense, gave her
courage to address her companion again; and
she asked, in the recklessness of despair, why he
contemplated returning so soon into Shropshire.</p>

<p>"Because," he said, "Lochleven is now a
fever spot upon my heart."</p>

<p>Christobelle wept silently. Captain Ponsonby
sat in the stern of the boat without speaking, as
though even his gay spirit could not resist the
heavy rain, and every one appeared to be cold,
weary, and dispirited. Except Fanny Ponsonby's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
voice, which sung, in low tones, a plaintive
air, not a sound escaped the party till they
reached the shore; and then commenced another
disagreeable contention between Lord Farnborough
and Captain Ponsonby.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral, I claim you <i>this</i> time," said
his lordship, hastily passing Fanny Ponsonby,
and offering his hand.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," cried Captain Ponsonby,
"I am before you half a minute, and have won
the prize."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why you persevere so
pertinaciously in appropriating Miss Wetheral,
Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"Can you, indeed, be ignorant upon such a
point, Farnborough? Take care, Miss Wetheral&mdash;step
firmly, and hold my hand."</p>

<p>"I must observe that you are needlessly officious,
Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"Tell me so elsewhere, Farnborough; at present,
I am attending upon Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>Christobelle looked imploringly at Sir John
Spottiswoode, but he was uncloaking Fanny Ponsonby,
and she had taken his arm, to share with
him the shelter of his umbrella. Christobelle
cared not, then, who became her escort. Captain
Ponsonby would not understand Lord Farnborough's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
anger, or reply to his observations;
he chatted gaily, as he unclasped the heavy boat-cloak,
which shrouded and encumbered Miss
Wetheral's figure.</p>

<p>"In spite of the storm, Miss Wetheral, you
spring brightly from your nest, untouched by the
raindrops; how do you manage to be so unlike
the rest of the world? We will not wait for the
other boat, which would detain us some time.
Let me get you safely to Clanmoray. Take my
arm fearlessly, and I will guide and support you
up the pathway. Farnborough will be kind
enough to escort the Miss Greys."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough threw a haughty look at
Captain Ponsonby, but he made no answer. His
lordship folded his cloak round his tall, slight
figure, and ascended the pathway in silence, and
without a companion. The Miss Greys remained
unattended on the shore of Lochleven.</p>

<p>"Farnborough is offended in earnest," observed
Captain Ponsonby, "and the gentle syrens are
to suffer. Miss Wetheral, you have put a feud
between me and my noble guest."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Captain Ponsonby, if any thing
unpleasant should arise between you and my
lord. It is altogether innocently done on my
part."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! yes, you look so dove-like and so guileless,
and yet you wield such warfare."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough appears easily irritated."</p>

<p>"Farnborough has been used to such easy
conquests, that he resents the appearance of
indifference. You have piqued him, Miss Wetheral;
nevertheless, I am concerned to see the
Miss Greys climbing the path alone in this rain.
This is an unexpected termination to our agreeable
day. It has been a really delightful day
to me."</p>

<p>"Lochleven can never disappoint its visitors,
Captain Ponsonby; even in this rain how beautiful
it is!"</p>

<p>"Lochleven would, though, if certain persons
and things did not combine to please me. I
have enjoyed myself to-day&mdash;but you were my
companion; I was with you at dinner&mdash;on the
wall of the ruin&mdash;every where; and I have spent
an extremely captivating day. I wonder what
kind of day Farnborough will represent it?"</p>

<p>"As very agreeable, no doubt."</p>

<p>"I differ with you, Miss Wetheral. Fanny
and your friend have seven league boots on, I
fancy&mdash;how they are bounding on! I admire
your friend, Miss Wetheral&mdash;fine, handsome fellow,
only he looks melancholy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; his eyes were fixed upon your hand a
full half hour at dinner&mdash;an hour, as we sat
talking, and all the voyage; yet, like Lady
Macbeth, his eyes were open, but their sense
was closed. He has a lady-love in the south."</p>

<p>Christobelle started at Captain Ponsonby's
suggestion. Impossible! she would not believe
it! She never heard such a thing alluded to.
If Sir John Spottiswoode loved in the south,
Mrs. Pynsent would have named it. How came
Captain Ponsonby to imagine such folly! The
very supposition of Sir John's attachment, however,
created pain, and chilled her into silence.
Captain Ponsonby's conversation soon became
wearisome, and she was glad when they reached
Clanmoray.</p>

<p>It was a relief to find Lord Farnborough absent,
and still more a relief to perceive the second
party approaching in the distance. She wanted
to be at Fairlee, to enjoy rest, and silence, and
free communion with her thoughts. Captain
Ponsonby's spirits were oppressive, and his polite
anxiety amounted to absolute annoyance. Christobelle
was ill, and restless, and eager to return
home.</p>

<p>The carriage was ordered as soon as Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Wetheral arrived, and the Fairlee party were
supplied by Miss Ponsonby with comfortable
refreshment in the article of stockings and shoes.
Every other apparel had been spared, by the
thoughtful cares of Mrs. Ponsonby, who had
wisely ordered a <i>dept</i> of cloaks and umbrellas
on board. Lord Farnborough did not appear
during their short rest at Clanmoray, and Captain
Ponsonby led Christobelle to the carriage,
after the ceremonies of leave-taking had concluded.
Miss Ponsonby hoped to enjoy Miss
Wetheral's society a little more exclusively at a
future time; but she seemed to be the entire
property of Arthur and Lord Farnborough at
St. Mungo's Isle. There was policy in allowing
novelty to exhaust its powers of pleasing; and
she would reserve her society till it would fill
up a chasm, formed by the secession of an admirer.
"Depend upon it, all this cannot last,
fair Christobelle, and, like me, you will some day
search in vain for a Tlmaque."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall not live to see the day, Miss Wetheral,"
said her brother, as he led Christobelle
forward.</p>

<p>"Don't attach the smallest credit to Arthur's
compliments," cried Miss Ponsonby, kissing her
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mary is very incorrect in her statements,
Miss Wetheral," said Captain Ponsonby, as they
passed through the hall. "You will receive me
with a smile, if I call at Fairlee to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"With many smiles, Captain Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"No, one little particular welcome smile is my
hope&mdash;give your many smiles to Farnborough.
Fare you well!"</p>

<p>Christobelle entered the carriage, and Sir John
Spottiswoode followed; but he seated himself
by Lady Wetheral's side. Captain Ponsonby
waved his hand, and stood in the rain, till the
trees concealed him from sight.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>


<p>Lady Wetheral spoke of the morning's entertainment
with perfect approbation, as they drove
home. "Every thing was so agreeably arranged&mdash;every
body was so inclined to be amused,
which constituted the charm of a party <i>al fresco</i>.
Lord Farnborough, perhaps, was less disposed to
consider himself at ease than the rest of the
group; but circumstances did go a little '<i> tort
et  travers</i>' with poor Lord Farnborough.
Some people were in the wrong place, assuredly,
which might create a little uneasiness; but, considering
the difficulty of selecting and arranging
a large morning party, it had been admirably
conducted. There was a little too much vivacity
in Captain Ponsonby's manner: he was rather too
<i>empress</i>&mdash;but Lord Farnborough displayed the
man of fashion in every movement." Christobelle
did not argue against her mother's opinions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Sir John Spottiswoode sat, determined to be
silent.</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough," continued Lady Wetheral,
"tells me he intends wandering round
Lochleven some weeks longer."</p>

<p>"At Clanmoray?" asked Christobelle.</p>

<p>"No, my love, he thinks of building at Kinross."
Christobelle sank back into her former
position, quite indifferent to the whereabout of
Lord Farnborough. Her ladyship resumed:&mdash;"Sir
John, what a lovely creature is Fanny
Ponsonby! I think I never beheld more beautiful
eyes!"</p>

<p>"Miss Ponsonby is a beautiful woman!" replied
Sir John Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"I mean Fanny Ponsonby, the lady you monopolized,
my dear Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>"I mean the same lady; but I was guilty of
no monopoly, Lady Wetheral."</p>

<p>"She is most lovely indeed. My dear Bell,
what an agreeable companion Miss Fanny Ponsonby
would be to share in your lake diversions!"</p>

<p>"No, mamma, pray don't ask Fanny Ponsonby&mdash;pray
think of no companion for me. I
am a solitary being. I love to be alone."</p>

<p>"My dear girl, you are jealous!"</p>

<p>"I am not jealous of any one, I hope. I admire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Miss Fanny Ponsonby&mdash;I think her very
lovely&mdash;but I require no companion."</p>

<p>"Would you live quite alone, my love? It is
not the wish of a young lady in general."</p>

<p>"When I feel particularly dull, mamma, I
will ask for Miss Fanny Ponsonby."</p>

<p>Christobelle could not clearly define her fear
of Miss Fanny Ponsonby's society, but her name
would evermore be coupled with painful feelings.
The first emotion of jealousy towards another had
been elicited by her, and perhaps the recollection
of that suffering inclined her to shun the innocent
cause of the subtle intruder. Christobelle
became restless at the mention of such a visitor
at Fairlee; and though she endeavoured to reason
away her alarm, the internal struggle increased.
What could her mother mean?</p>

<p>The clouds broke away towards the evening,
and the rain ceased; the terrace was soon dry,
though the raindrops hung upon every leaf, and
the bright lake lay tranquil after the storm.
Lochleven was beautiful in its freshness, and the
green tints of its wooded sides stood out in
deeper and brighter light and shade from the
heavy showers. Yet Sir John Spottiswoode did
not ask Christobelle to walk with him; he did
not ask her to admire with him the setting sun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
or to look with him upon the deepening shades
of evening. He sat profoundly attentive over
"Bacon's Essays," and not once did his eye or
lip address her. She also endeavoured to read,
but her thoughts wandered over the incidents of
the morning. Her eyes fixed themselves upon
the lake, and not upon the page of history, as
she considered the disappointments of the day,
and mused upon the changed manner of Sir John
Spottiswoode. She wished they had never joined
the party to St. Mungo's Isle&mdash;she wished she
had persevered in her solitary habits, and never
accepted the invitation to Clanmoray.</p>

<p>Captain Ponsonby had wearied her, and Lord
Farnborough's manner had offended her. Were
these things an equivalent to the estranged manner
of her friend? She wished she had been
Fanny Ponsonby, for then Sir John Spottiswoode
would have sought her. She wished she
had been Fanny Ponsonby, for then the gentlemen
would have avoided her. She had no
pleasure in being so publicly attended by
Captain Ponsonby and his guest. She would
have given worlds to have been silent and free
from remark.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral took her seat by Christobelle's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
side, as she gazed vacantly upon the sparkling
waters.</p>

<p>"Your thoughts are far away, my love, and
yet I can guess their flight. They are at this
moment at Clanmoray, and you are thinking of
Fanny Ponsonby."</p>

<p>The truth of the remark startled Christobelle.
It brought the colour into her face and forehead.</p>

<p>"Never mind Fanny Ponsonby, Bell. You
have no rival there!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so, mamma?" she exclaimed.
"How can you possibly tell his feelings?"</p>

<p>"His attention was exclusively given to you,
Bell, though I confess you coquetted rather
rashly."</p>

<p>"With whom did I coquette, mamma? I cannot
endure that expression, it sounds so frivolous
and vain."</p>

<p>"My love, strangers would remark you flirted
too much with Captain Ponsonby, though <i>I</i>
could comprehend your intentions, and I was
amused with your little <i>tracasseries</i>."</p>

<p>"But how can you judge of his feelings towards
Miss Fanny Ponsonby, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Because her attachment to him could not
be concealed; it was apparent in her looks, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in the pain she discovered during his attentions
to you."</p>

<p>"We hardly exchanged words, mamma," remarked
Christobelle, in great surprise; "and
then only in the boat returning from the island."</p>

<p>"I am ignorant of what took place during
your return, my love; but I saw enough to convince
me that Lord Farnborough does not return
the love of poor Fanny Ponsonby."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough!&mdash;and her thoughts were
with Sir John Spottiswoode! Her eyes fell
upon the Lake in bitter disappointment. "I
thought <i>he</i> had watched me&mdash;I thought <i>he</i> had
not cared for Fanny Ponsonby!" were her
silent reflections.</p>

<p>"I see," continued Lady Wetheral, in tones
of triumph, "his lordship is jealous of Captain
Ponsonby; and there you acted with great tact.
I am sure it will lead to a proposal. He will
be afraid of Arthur Ponsonby, and it will lead
him to take a hasty step, but that step will exalt
you into the future Duchess of Forfar. I fancied
his Grace asthmatic this morning; he certainly
wheezed very painfully as we walked up the
pathway. This will raise you far above your
sisters, my love; far more exalted than Julia.
Lord Farnborough has proved my physician; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
has entirely chased away my nervous complaints."</p>

<p>Christobelle could not answer. She quitted
the room in haste, and took shelter in her own
apartments. There she prostrated herself, and
prayed for a tranquil spirit. She knew her
mother's temper, and was aware of her ambitious
spirit; but she did not like Lord Farnborough,
and never would she sell herself to be
his wife. She would not confess that she loved
Sir John Spottiswoode, or that she had given
her affections to one who did not value the gift;
but she would surely and perseveringly decline
Lord Farnborough, if indeed that hasty step
was ever taken which was to proceed from anger
towards his friend, Captain Ponsonby.</p>

<p>Christobelle had witnessed Clara's misery,
and suspected that Julia was not happy in her
grandeur, therefore, she would not become the
third prey to her mother's overweening ambition.
She might suffer reproaches and harsh
conduct, but she would not marry for wealth,
and pine away in silent misery, a beacon to the
thoughtless and the avaricious. If Sir John
Spottiswoode quitted Fairlee, and if Lochleven
was a fever-spot upon his heart, Christobelle
felt she must endure sorrow: it could not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
more despairing than the feelings of Fanny Ponsonby,
to whom her heart now clung in sympathy,
and without pain. Fanny Ponsonby
would be now a companion most grateful to her
taste; all jealous fears were ended, and they
could walk and weep together in fellowship.
Poor Fanny Ponsonby! Christobelle wept for
her and for herself. She remembered her abstracted
look, and the haste with which she fled
from her brother's remarks upon love. She
remembered the downcast eye when Sir John
Spottiswoode addressed her upon the subject of
a lover's heart, and she saw her weep during the
singing of "Desolate is the dwelling of Morna."
How her heart yearned now to be near her!</p>

<p>Christobelle felt too unwell to return again
into the drawing-room. The struggle of her
thoughts brought on severe headache, and she
tried to forget her disquietude in sleep. Lady
Wetheral visited her daughter, before she retired
for the night, and smiled as she spoke of her
hasty retreat.</p>

<p>"Did Sir John Spottiswoode miss me?"
Christobelle asked in some perturbation, as she
rose from an unrefreshing doze, to listen to her
remarks.</p>

<p>"No, my love, I believe not. He expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
very polite regrets at your indisposition, but he
has been reading the whole evening. He mentioned
his return into Shropshire the end of this
week."</p>

<p>Christobelle sank back in silence upon her
pillow.</p>

<p>"Good night, my love, I will not keep you
awake; but I trust your headache will be slept
away. Take sal-volatile, and those nervous-drops,
they always did me good, and we shall
see what to-morrow will bring forth."</p>

<p>"So soon does he go, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my love. I think it would be advisable
to ask Lord Farnborough to Fairlee, to
superintend his intended little sporting-box at
Kinross. I shall sound your father. Good night
Bell."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral retired, and left Christobelle
again in silence and in darkness. She could
not sleep. The night passed <i>so</i> slowly, as she
lay revolving all these things in her mind!
When she was happy, her nights flew by, and
she rose refreshed; but now the hours lagged
heavily, and her waking thoughts were upon the
departure of Sir John Spottiswoode, and the
introduction of Lord Farnborough in his place.
She did not rise refreshed. She was tired and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
unhappy when she descended into the breakfast-room.
Sir John Spottiswoode was there alone;
and, as he paid the compliments of the morning,
his voice was thick, and sounded hoarse. Christobelle
was sure he had caught cold upon the
water, and it was to protect her that he exposed
himself to wet, and had thrown off his cloak.
She was overcome by the recollection, and,
though she approached him timidly, she was in
anxious fear lest he should suffer by his attention.
His hand was heated as it touched hers
in salutation, and she held it in alarm.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are feverish and ill, and you have
caught cold by giving me your cloak! What
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I have a little headache and sore throat,"
he replied, smiling; "but it will pass away, I
hope, in the course of the day."</p>

<p>"It was that cloak," replied Christobelle,
quite absorbed with fear, and totally forgetful
that her hand was still held by him&mdash;"it was
that cloak which you took off so suddenly,
against my wishes. I was sure you would be
ill!"</p>

<p>"I am not ill," he answered, feelingly: "your
kind sympathy has cured me; but let me observe
<i>your</i> pale cheeks in return, and let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mourn over <i>them</i>." Sir John Spottiswoode led
her to the window, and looked so kindly at her,
that tears sprang into her eyes. "Here are
tokens of a restless night," he said&mdash;"here are
signs of sleepless hours, and heavy thoughts,
my dear pupil. Would I could calm your
gentle heart!"</p>

<p>"Then stay at Fairlee!" she exclaimed, as
she wept without control, and cared not for
the consequences of her indiscreet words&mdash;"stay
at Fairlee, and be as kind as you used
to be!" Christobelle felt the arm of her companion
drawn round her, and she was pressed
to his heart, as he replied.&mdash;</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> remain, dearest pupil, I <i>will</i> remain
at Fairlee, whatever pain it may cost me! I
will do whatever you bid me do, to give you
pleasure. God forbid <i>I</i> should ever give you
a moment's sorrow! I would sooner suffer a
thousand pangs, than see you weep one moment.
Why do you weep, and distress my heart?"</p>

<p>Christobelle could not help it. Was it, indeed,
painful to remain at Fairlee? Captain
Ponsonby was right, then, in his suggestion&mdash;there
<i>was</i> a lady in the south! She could not
reply; a suffocating sensation precluded all
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you here so early?" continued Sir
John Spottiswoode, in gentle accents, as Christobelle
still leaned against him; "and why are your
spirits so agitated, and your rest broken? If
such is your present state, what will your affectionate
heart endure hereafter? Your delicate
frame is unequal to contend with such deep
emotions!"</p>

<p>Christobelle made a strong effort to check her
weeping fit, and she became more tranquil.
Sir John Spottiswoode's arm still surrounded
and supported her; but she felt that, when its
dear support should be withdrawn, she would be
cast upon the wide world for ever.</p>

<p>"Your friends are round you," resumed her
companion, "and you shall be the arbitress of
<i>my</i> movements. I will not quit Lochleven
while I can be of use to its dear inmate. Oh, my
dear Christobelle! how the schoolmaster will
guard his pupil! But when," he added, hesitatingly,
drawing her closer to him, and even
clasping her to his heart&mdash;"when will he be
here again?"</p>

<p>"Whom do you speak of? Captain Ponsonby?"
she exclaimed; "he wearies me, and every body
wearies me!"</p>

<p>"I do not speak of him. I do not speak of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Captain Ponsonby," replied Sir John Spottiswoode,
withdrawing his arm hastily, and moving
a few paces. "I mean another and happier
man. You know whom I would name." He
advanced again to the window, where Christobelle
remained rooted. "You know whom I
allude to, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough?" she articulated, with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Sir John would not meet her eye.</p>

<p>"I did mean that person. Will he not visit
Fairlee, Miss Wetheral? Will he not? no, he
is not worthy of such a heart&mdash;of such powerful
affection!" He walked from the window
to the door, and again he turned, and approached
Christobelle. "It is a severe trial to
have waited and loved as I have done, and yet
suffer disappointment. It was a strange fancy&mdash;was
it not, my pupil?&mdash;to wait so long, and
hope so perseveringly? But I will not quit
Fairlee, since you bid me not."</p>

<p>Christobelle could not comprehend Sir John
Spottiswoode's emotion. She could not divine
his allusions; she only grasped at his promise
to remain, and even that was balm to her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she repeated, "stay, and take my
part, for I know I shall appeal to papa and
you, if I am reproached."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who dares presume to reproach you? Who
dares to offer a harsh word to you? By the
heavens above, if I heard his false lips utter one
syllable of unkindness to a creature too gentle
and excellent for his worthless mind, I would
strike him dead!" Sir John Spottiswoode's eyes
struck fire, and his tall figure became still more
erect.</p>

<p>"Of whom are you talking?&mdash;whose lips are
false?" asked Christobelle, in stupid amazement.</p>

<p>"I know him!" continued Sir John Spottiswoode,
kindling as he spoke; "but I will follow
him through the world, if he gives one pang to
such a heart as your's, dearest and loveliest pupil,
creature of my fancy and my heart! He is
not worthy of you, Christobelle." He stopped,
and fixed his eyes upon her with an expression
so wretched, that she took his hand in terror:
he snatched it from her.</p>

<p>"Do not break my heart, Christobelle; and
do not touch me, if you have mercy. Withdraw
your wish, and let me quit Fairlee for ever!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she cried, clasping her hands,
and sinking into a chair; "if you go, who will
stand between me and my mother?"</p>

<p>"Your mother!" Sir John Spottiswoode gazed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
upon Christobelle with astonishment. "Your
mother!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"I cannot, will not marry Lord Farnborough,"
exclaimed Christobelle, almost bending in agonized
feelings; "and who will save me from her
anger!"</p>

<p>"Christobelle!" burst from her companion.
She heeded not.</p>

<p>"I will not be driven into misery to minister
to ambition. It is so cruel&mdash;so very cruel."</p>

<p>"Christobelle!" again ejaculated Sir John
Spottiswoode, "look at me!"</p>

<p>Christobelle could not look up&mdash;she could not
shake off her weight of misery. She sat with
her hands pressed tightly upon her heart. "If
you leave me, who will assist my father in warding
off my reproaches? Who will soften her
heart, and soothe my poor spirit? Who will
plead for me, and save me?"</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode knelt by her side, and
took her cold hands in his. "Christobelle," he
said, "I will plead for you, and save you. Will
you recompense me in return? Will <i>you</i> love
and cherish the heart which adores and blesses
you?&mdash;which would suffer all evils, all indignities,
for your dear sake?"</p>

<p>Christobelle sat transfixed. She dared not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
breathe, lest the vision should vanish from her
sight.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you, Christobelle, how I have
waited for you, and lived upon the hope of
making you love me, when I was far away?
Shall I tell you how I watched over you, and
lingered till I could ask for you?"</p>

<p>Christobelle could only smile a reply to her
lover's questions, and she was again folded in
his arms. Oh, happy, thrice happy moment!</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you," demanded her companion,
"how your mother deceived me, yesterday
morning, when I spoke of you upon the terrace?
No, I will not allude to it now, since all
my horrible fears are ended."</p>

<p>"Tell me nothing now," she replied, "but
let me return to my room, to think&mdash;to assure
myself this is not a vision&mdash;to consider all things
over." Miss Wetheral rose.</p>

<p>"Will you go with me to our rocky seat, after
breakfast," he asked, "if I resign you now? I
am loth to lose you from my sight; stay a few
moments longer, dearest."</p>

<p>"Not now; but I will walk with you to our
old place of refuge. The bell will ring, and I
am too agitated to meet my mother. I could
meet no one at this moment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, my Chrystal, one&mdash;one more embrace!"
and Christobelle was encircled again in the arms
of the best and dearest of human beings. She
flew from his embrace to the sanctuary of her
own apartment, and her first movement was
prayer. She prayed for humility; she prayed
for strength to bear her load of happiness; and
she prayed that she might not love the creature
beyond the Creator. When Christobelle rose
from her knees, she sat down to think upon all
these things.</p>

<p>Sir John and Lady Wetheral were at the
breakfast-table, when Christobelle descended the
second time. She did not once meet her lover's
eye, for she could not endure its brightness; but
her bosom had cast its load of sorrow, and her
thoughts danced in the beams of a new happiness.
Lady Wetheral was pleased by her appearance.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, that little headache was a
<i>tour de jongle</i> to get rid of us all. Your dreams
were pleasant, for your eyes sparkle, and you
look most amusingly demure."</p>

<p>Christobelle cast her eyes upon the ground;
a deep and most distressing suffusion crimsoned
her face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," continued her ladyship, "your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
gay dreams may have prognosticated good. I
have also my dream. I am dreaming that friends
from Clanmoray will call to-day."</p>

<p>Christobelle was silent. She knew her mother
dreamt not of the blow which awaited her.
She knew her ladyship did not dream of her attachment
to Sir John Spottiswoode. She could
not awaken her at that moment to the fallacy of
her hopes, neither could she lend herself to deception.
She was aware her mother's ambitious
wishes believed her young heart unable to contend
against a dukedom, and that her fear of
Sir John Spottiswoode had ceased from the
morning of Lord Farnborough's visit. She had
then chatted to his lordship, in the full flow of
happy spirits, and her mother's ambition had
"o'ertopped" its meaning. She could not lead
her into deeper error.</p>

<p>Christobelle's appetite was gone, and she
scarcely touched the small French roll which
lay upon her plate. She had eaten and drank
in sorrow, though the meal did not afford nourishment;
but, in joy, the very sight of food became
loathsome. It appeared to Christobelle's
mind, that Sir John Spottiswoode's love&mdash;his
expressed love&mdash;was intellectual food, sufficient
for many days; that her spirit would renew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
under its blessed influence, and that creature-comforts
suited only the labourer and the hireling.
It was impossible to remain long at the
breakfast-table. She felt the triumphant glance
of her lover was upon her, and her heart longed
for solitude, to question itself again upon its sudden
happiness. She wanted to ask herself, over
and over, if it was really true that she was loved
by Sir John Spottiswoode&mdash;if it was really true
that her affections were returned, and that she
was happy?</p>

<p>Christobelle quitted the breakfast-room as
early as politeness would admit, for the desultory
conversation of her companions was painful
to her thoughts, and disturbed her train of mental
reasonings. Sir John Spottiswoode watched
her retreat, but she could not meet his imploring
look. She knew its purport, and she would surely
keep her promise of walking with him to the
rocky seat; but she <i>must</i> be alone for some
time. She required a short season of solitude,
to task her thoughts and collect her scattered
energies; and, above all, she wished to see her
father. Before Christobelle could surrender herself
to the floating visions of joy which crowded
on her brain, she must see her father!</p>

<p>Christobelle remained an hour walking up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
down her dressing-room, ere she could quell the
emotions of her soul, and then she descended
into her father's study. He was reading; and,
for some moments, an indefinable sensation of
shame kept her silent. At last, Christobelle
gained courage to address her kind and indulgent
parent. "Papa, if you are not engaged,
I wish to speak to you, if you please."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral laid down his book, and
assured his child his attention was ever alive to
his Chrystal's summons: but she became agitated
and confused as she approached the subject.
"Papa," she stammered forth, "I came
to say something, and I don't know how to say
it."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral smiled, and drew her to
him. "Well, my love, which is it&mdash;my Lord
Farnborough, or the humble Captain? It must
be a novel subject which confuses my poor little
companion, and it <i>must</i> be a love affair. Which
of them is intending to deprive me of your society,
Chrystal?"</p>

<p>"Neither, papa." Christobelle became still
more distressed and confused at his mistake.</p>

<p>"Well, then, it must be the old duke, or that
young man with the whip. I cannot approve of
either, my love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Christobelle threw her arms round his neck.
"No, no, papa; think again."</p>

<p>"Ah, I have it, Chrystal. It is that young
wanderer upon the terrace, who is watching the
windows of your apartments so eagerly." Christobelle's
head fell upon his shoulder. "Be not
alarmed, my child. If there is a heart as kind
as Boscawen's, and as affectionate as Pynsent's,
it is the heart of Spottiswoode. Now go, and
tell him what I say."</p>

<p>Christobelle was too confused and too joyful
to speak her gratitude, but her heart was known
to the parent who had loved and watched over
her from the hour of her birth. He led her to
the door. "Go, my best love, and tell your
friend, and my friend, that he has set at rest all
my hopes and fears for your welfare. Tell him
it is only into his hands I would relinquish my
child. There, fly to the poor puzzled youth, for
he is lingering under your windows." Sir John
Wetheral closed the door, and his daughter was
alone in the hall, almost stunned by the rapidity
of the morning's eventful incidents. She would
have proceeded to the terrace, but her mother's
voice called her to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Bell, is that you?"</p>

<p>Christobelle found her ladyship seated in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lounging chair, employed with her knotting. She
looked up.</p>

<p>"I thought I recognized your step, my love;
the fairy step, as Lord Farnborough calls it. I
wish you to remain entirely in the grounds, Bell;
indeed, I wish you not to quit the house this
morning. Stay with me, and wind these silks;
they plague and impede my work."</p>

<p>"I am only going to the cliff, mamma: if any
body comes, you will be so good as to send for
me, perhaps."</p>

<p>"My love, I cannot send the whole establishment
in different directions for you, upon all
occasions. Your walks become a serious evil."</p>

<p>"I will remain on the terrace, then, mamma:
I have promised to join Sir John Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>"I do not approve of such daily walks, Bell&mdash;such
wild roaming over the hills. I wish you to
wind these obdurate skeins for me: you forget
caution and propriety. I insist upon your
avoidance of Sir John Spottiswoode this morning.
Lord Farnborough must not always find you appropriated."</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode appeared at the window
which opened upon the terrace at this moment.
Lady Wetheral kissed her hand to him,
and he entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Spottiswoode, assist me to persuade
my restive daughter that so much exercise is
hurtful. I wish her to remain with me this
morning."</p>

<p>"The day is so beautiful, Lady Wetheral, and
the air so reviving!" he observed. "I am sure
this fresh breeze will exhilarate her, and bring
the roses into her cheeks."</p>

<p>Her ladyship raised her glass to her eye, and
slightly examined her daughter's countenance.</p>

<p>"Bell, my love, your bloom is less vivid, but
I think I prefer the delicacy of its present tone.
I have very essential reasons for wishing you to
remain with me this morning. I feel languid
and unwell&mdash;very languid after the fatigues of
yesterday." Lady Wetheral's voice grew fainter
as she uttered the last sentence: and she sank
back in her chair, in an attitude of languor.
"My love, pray wind those skeins for me. I
am a poor creature, you see."</p>

<p>It was useless to contend: Christobelle's
destined walk must give way to her mother's
quiet determination that she should not become
conspicuous with Sir John Spottiswoode, and it
was her duty to yield to her wishes. Christobelle
relinquished, therefore, all hopes of a
<i>tte--tte</i> with her lover, and prepared to obey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
silks. She had not courage to meet the disappointed
eye of her companion, nor indeed did she
wish him to discover, by the expression of her
own orbs, how severely she suffered by her
obedience.</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode was silent under the
existing order of things, and forbore to offer an
opinion upon its unfitness; but he quietly assisted
Christobelle's operations, and held the
skeins for her better convenience in winding
them. The whole affair arranged itself in such
perfect pantomime, that she could not resist a
smile and glance at her assistant, which amply
repaid her self-control. An expression of gratified
happiness played upon his manly countenance,
and lighted up his eyes, which communicated
itself to Christobelle's heart, and caused
intense gratitude for the blessing conferred upon
her in the gift of his affections. She felt that
she could meet her mother's opposition, her
irony, her bitterness, with patience, since she
had won all that seemed valuable upon earth&mdash;all
that was excellent, and affectionate, and kind&mdash;the
heart of Sir John Spottiswoode. She had
received the blessing too, at the very moment
when her fears believed him indifferent to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
elicited by Fanny Ponsonby, and continued
by the surmise of Captain Ponsonby; yet it was
a change so suddenly effected, that she could
scarcely believe in its reality. Her lover knelt
before her, holding the extended skein, yet she
could not place faith in the certainty that all
was not a dream: she heard her mother speak,
and yet it appeared a vision, from which, she
trusted, she might never wake.</p>

<p>"My dear Spottiswoode, you are Hercules
with the distaff."</p>

<p>"I have made my choice too, like Hercules,
Lady Wetheral. I have selected virtue, and I find
I have also gained pleasure, for they are seldom
separate, after all. Pleasure does not include
virtue always: but virtue rarely moves without
pleasure; I find it so now. I am virtuously
employed, and it is my greatest pleasure. I
have great pleasure in assisting your labours,
Lady Wetheral."</p>

<p>"You appear to great advantage, Spottiswoode;
but I hope you are not making a pain
of pleasure. Bell has already broken her thread
twice."</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral is all kindness; she bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
I am very trying to her patience. Another
thread broken! My dear Miss Wetheral, be
calm."</p>

<p>"I believe I must relinquish it, for a few
moments," Christobelle observed; "my hands
are so tremulous."</p>

<p>"I am going to lecture you, Miss Wetheral,
to spare your mamma the trouble of pronouncing
an exhortation in her languid state. Pray,
make another trial, and hold your hand steadily&mdash;<i>so</i>."
Sir John Spottiswoode pressed her hand
affectionately, and held it as he continued&mdash;"Now,
my dear pupil, you must try to feel tranquil,
and be assured all efforts succeed, if they
are made with perseverance."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Christobelle, laughingly;
"my next effort shall be boldly made."</p>

<p>"But, stay," he added, detaining the hand
she would have withdrawn, "stay one moment,
while I examine this entanglement." Sir John
Spottiswoode bent forward to conceal his movement
and Christobelle's confusion from Lady
Wetheral's notice. "This is rather a puzzling
affair at this moment, Miss Wetheral, but we
must succeed in time by mutual perseverance&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you are calm, and I am near you, to offer
counsel. Do you perfectly understand me?"</p>

<p>"I believe I do. I am to be calm, and try to
unravel this puzzling work in patience. I quite
understand you, and I will try to do so."</p>

<p>"When did my pupil ever misunderstand my
words?" he replied, with energy; and, forgetful
of his own cautions and Lady Wetheral's presence,
he caught Christobelle's hand to his lips.
She was terrified at the action, but her mother
had little time to express her indignation, for
the door was suddenly thrown open, and the
servant announced Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>His lordship entered with a heated and raised
complexion, and he attentively surveyed the
apartment, as he spoke.</p>

<p>"So I am before him at last. I thought I
should find the fox in his earth, for he was off
an hour ago: this is capital."</p>

<p>"My dear lord, you are most welcome. This
is really a neighbourly action." Lady Wetheral
rose promptly from her languid repose, and received
her visitor with bright smiles of pleasure.
Lord Farnborough recollected himself, and recovered
his self-possession, as he paid his <i>devoirs</i>
to the party.</p>

<p>"I fear I came in rather hastily, Lady Wetheral;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
but you will excuse my eager manner,
when you learn its motive. I thought Ponsonby
had been before me. We have had a race
for it, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Captain Ponsonby has not called, I believe,"
replied Lady Wetheral, in tones of mingled triumph
and hope, "unless he is closeted with my
husband."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed his lordship, "then he has
preceded me? Lady Wetheral, allow me an
immediate conference, if you please."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord; we will retire into my
own sitting-room."</p>

<p>"Here, if you please, for time is very precious.
Will you allow me to lead you upon the terrace,
Lady Wetheral? You must excuse my impetuosity."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral accepted Lord Farnborough's
offered arm, and she was hurried upon the terrace;
but not a glance or movement on her part
betokened fatigue, or a remnant of her past
languor. Her step was firm, and her eyes
beamed with expected triumph.</p>

<p>"Chrystal, my own Chrystal," cried Sir John
Spottiswoode, as the receding figures were lost
to sight, "if ever I loved and admired you more
truly and fondly than I fancied I could do, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was at the moment you renounced your plans to
obey a parent, with a smile on your lip, and regret
in your dear heart."</p>

<p>"But my real misery is yet to come," exclaimed
Christobelle, though she felt herself
pressed to the warm heart of her lover, and
there was blessedness in the pressure.</p>

<p>"But why so?" he asked tenderly; "what
has Chrystal to fear?"</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough's visit is connected with
<i>myself</i>; I know it as surely as if I heard the
words spoken. I know I have so much to endure
from my mother!"</p>

<p>"But you are mine, Chrystal; and who can
take you from me now? Are you not my own,
my very own?"</p>

<p>"I know it: I feel secure of <i>you</i>; but my
mother will say such harsh things!"</p>

<p>"Fear not, my beloved. If we are true to
each other, surely we can endure a little trial of
patience."</p>

<p>Yes, he spoke truly. Christobelle could endure
a long, long trial for <i>his</i> love. She could
suffer a protracted misery, to deserve a heart so
excellent. She had, too, a dear hope to sustain
her, for her father approved her sentiments, and
he would shelter her from the harsh reproaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
meet her lover's entreaty to be patient with
smiles. She told him she would endure all
things with firmness&mdash;that she would not anticipate
evil. She called upon him to rejoice with
her in her father's approval, and she told him of
her interview and confession. How swiftly did
their short <i>tte--tte</i> glide by! and how delightedly
did Christobelle listen to his fears
respecting Lord Farnborough!</p>

<p>"But why did you not tell <i>me</i> all this? Why
did you suppose such incredible things in silence&mdash;to
leave me in such cruel and useless suspense?
Oh, Spottiswoode, <i>one</i> word yesterday morning,
and all this had been spared us!"</p>

<p>"No, I was silenced by your mother for ever,
in our morning lounge upon the terrace. Had
you not disclaimed all idea of Lord Farnborough
this morning, and had not hope rushed into my
heart unbidden, by the confession of your misery,
I had never dared to breathe a word of my
sentiments. I believed you loved Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"She could not tell you <i>that</i>! Surely my
mother did not tell you so&mdash;oh! she never told
you I cared for <i>him</i>!" Christobelle shuddered
at the thought; but the encircling arms of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
lover restrained the movement which impelled
her to start from her chair.</p>

<p>"I was assured your heart was on the point
of acknowledging Lord Farnborough's power,
Chrystal&mdash;and your mother spoke in terms of
proud approval."</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother, my mother!" exclaimed
Christobelle, weeping at the thought of her cruel
policy; "I might have been sacrificed for ever
to your ambitious wishes! I should have been
given in utter wretchedness to a man I did not
love, and consigned to hopeless misery!"</p>

<p>"Weep not, dearest," said her companion, "and
I will tell you how your presence shall brighten
and bless the scenes of my solitary wanderings at
Alverton&mdash;how it shall illumine my future life,
and reward me for my patient waiting. Did
you but know, my love, how I feared you would
be appropriated, ere I could claim an interest in
your heart, and, yet, how firmly I resolved to
leave you to the working of its own resolves, you
would pity and love me for my resolution."</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i> love you!" Christobelle concealed her
face upon his shoulder. They were silent for
some moments, but his lips were pressed upon
her forehead, and she was in his arms&mdash;both too
engrossed, with the certainty of being at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
happy, to break the deep silence. Christobelle
forgot her mother&mdash;she forgot Lord Farnborough;
she thought not of his errand, or her
future anger. She was in a trance:&mdash;she thought
all reproach&mdash;all suffering&mdash;all unkindness, had
no further power to wound, for she belonged to
her lover, and he would shelter her, as he did at
that moment, in his beloved embrace. The
world without might struggle with deep and
mighty commotion&mdash;it might drink deeply of the
elements of strife, and do battle with the stirring
natures of mortality&mdash;but <i>she</i> was safe from
strife and suffering now. She had given herself,
heart and soul, to the man she loved dearer than
herself, or aught in creation besides. She was
the promised bride of Sir John Spottiswoode!</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<p>Lord Farnborough's mission was speedily developed
to Lady Wetheral, as they paced the
terrace together. His lordship at once opened
the subject, which lay so closely upon his mind's
peace, and at once laid his dukedom at Christobelle's
feet.</p>

<p>"Upon my honour, Lady Wetheral, my respect
for your daughter is excessive, and I wish to make
known my sentiments at such an early period,
because I see I have rivals. Ponsonby is over
head and ears in love, and there's no knowing
how many more will become so; for her beauty
is really something extraordinary. Miss Wetheral
is the loveliest creature I have ever
seen."</p>

<p>"My daughter is flattered by such remarks,
my dear lord, and her mother feels proud of such
an encomium. She is a treasure to me, in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sense of the word, as she will prove to the man
who wins her."</p>

<p>"I can offer much more than Ponsonby," continued
Lord Farnborough; "and I think, at this
very early stage of our acquaintance, an earl's
coronet in possession, and a duke's strawberry-leaves
in prospect, may perhaps entitle me to her
notice beyond the claims of humbler men."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough may claim a lady's preference
upon still higher grounds than mere rank
or fortune," said her ladyship, with smiling approbation,
and gently pressing his lordship's arm.
Lord Farnborough was gratified by the compliment.</p>

<p>"It is very soothing, Lady Wetheral, to my
feelings, to be assured that my suit is not displeasing
to her parents. May I hope Miss Wetheral's
affections are disengaged?"</p>

<p>"I can answer for my daughter's free heart,
my lord. I am sure&mdash;indeed, I know her affections
are untouched."</p>

<p>"You think Ponsonby has not got before me
into her good opinion?"</p>

<p>"I have authority to say, Captain Ponsonby
has not <i>yet</i> succeeded, my dear lord."</p>

<p>"Ponsonby has been very successful with the
female heart, and I know he was attentive yesterday&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
he has nothing to offer. I think
Sir John Spottiswoode fluttered round Fanny
Ponsonby&mdash;nothing <i>there</i>, you think, Lady
Wetheral?"</p>

<p>"My daughter's affections are not so lightly
won, my lord; and my interest is not with Sir
John Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>"It would be a great feather in my cap, to
win Miss Wetheral from all competitors. She
would be a star in town, and cause a great sensation.
She shall be the best-dressed woman in
St. James's, if she appears there as Lady Farnborough.
She would have the most splendid
jewels in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"My dear child's tastes are simple and unexpensive,
Lord Farnborough. She does not court
notoriety. Her heart is happiest in her own
home."</p>

<p>"That is a lady's throne," observed his lordship,
"and man is happy, who marries a creature
devoted to his comforts."</p>

<p>"Is the duke aware of your present application,
my lord?"</p>

<p>"I believe he surmises what I am about, Lady
Wetheral, for your daughter's charms almost led
to a quarrel this morning with Ponsonby. It
decided me at once to announce my wishes here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
or he would be laying siege to Miss Wetheral.
I saw that pretty clearly. However, if you stand
my friend, Lady Wetheral, I am safe."</p>

<p>"My lord, I <i>think</i> my wishes will point my
daughter's affections; I believe I possess her
entire confidence, and the control of her judgment;
and the very proper way in which you
announce your wish of an alliance with our
family, prompts me to exert my influence in your
favour. I admire your high-spirited address,
my lord, in consulting <i>me</i> before you applied to
the lady."</p>

<p>"I wish to do every thing in order," replied
his lordship, "and I know Ponsonby has serious
intentions, which gave me some alarm. When
may I pay my respects to Miss Wetheral? Will
she allow me an interview soon, Lady Wetheral?
You may conceive my impatience to be received
as one of your family."</p>

<p>"I will summon my daughter, my lord, and
leave you together: I am sure of my child's ingenuous
heart; and she will scorn to allow any
man to remain in suspense, when his full intentions
and hopes are disclosed."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's appearance at the sitting-room
window unfolded her thoughts and expectations
to Christobelle's mind in one glance. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
subdued look of triumph, the forced calmness
of manner, contrasted with the glowing expression
of every feature, left her daughter not an
instant in ignorance of what had taken place.
She felt that her hour of trial was already arrived&mdash;that
she must collect her thoughts, and
meet, with patient firmness, all the crosses in her
path&mdash;that she must redeem her promise of
patience to her lover. Christobelle had little
leisure for mental reflection, for Lady Wetheral
entered the room, and compelled attention.</p>

<p>"My dear love, Lord Farnborough requests
the honour of your attention for a few moments:
I have promised that you will join his lordship
on the terrace. Your instant acquiescence will
oblige me, Bell." Sir John Spottiswoode quitted
the room. She continued&mdash;"It is a relief to
lose sight of one's friends for a few minutes; I
wish Spottiswoode had found amusement elsewhere.
Hasten, my dear girl, and meet me after
your little consultation in my room. I won't
say a word till you rejoin me; but, my dear
child, this is the very happiest hour in my existence&mdash;a
happier hour than when my Julia
told me she had won Ennismore. My wish,
Bell, has been gloriously fulfilled; every thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
has crowned that wish, without an effort. I am
a proud and happy mother!"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma," cried Christobelle, kneeling
before her, "do not misunderstand me, and do
not hope against hope. I cannot marry Lord
Farnborough!"</p>

<p>"Do not rouse me into anger, Bell, as you
hope for peace in this world; and do not let me
find you a mean-minded creature, content to
live in insignificance. Go instantly, and meet
Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>"I cannot go, mamma; I have no affections
to bestow upon Lord Farnborough&mdash;do not let
me meet him! Tell him, I deplore his disappointment,
if it proves such&mdash;but I cannot see
him!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's face turned pale as marble,
as she caught Christobelle's hand, and dragged
her forward.</p>

<p>"Tell me only that you are thinking of Captain
Ponsonby, to break my heart at once, Bell!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not Ponsonby&mdash;I care not for Captain
Ponsonby, mamma: but do not look so pale
and angry&mdash;you terrify me!"</p>

<p>"So you have led me into error&mdash;deceived my
hopes&mdash;and destroyed me, while you sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the love of Spottiswoode! Is that truly so?
Is it Spottiswoode you love?"</p>

<p>Christobelle shrank from her grasp in terror.
Lady Wetheral's face and manner became fearfully
changed; she caught the back of a chair to
support herself.</p>

<p>"Bell, I have answered for your dutiful submission
to my wishes. I have promised for you&mdash;I
have told Lord Farnborough you are free.
Go to him, and say that I spoke in truth. A
dukedom, Bell!&mdash;a dukedom!&mdash;my last, my
only child, a dukedom is offered you!"</p>

<p>Christobelle sat in terrified silence: she could
not endure to see her mother suffer, but she had
no consolation to offer. Lady Wetheral approached
her, and took her cold hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Bell, a child never yet prospered that gave
pain to her parent, and now you can raise me
into happiness by your obedience. To see my
daughter a duchess&mdash;a duchess, moving in
stately magnificence, is the dearest wish of my
heart. It has been my hope, ever since your
first introduction to Lord Farnborough&mdash;my
dearest project by day and by night, my earthly
contemplation for many days! Go to him, Bell, for
I have answered for you, and you <i>will</i> go; think
better of it, think of your future regrets, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
repentance will come too late! Go to Lord
Farnborough, I command you, Bell."</p>

<p>A mother's commands had never been disputed
by Christobelle, and it was, perhaps, better to
meet his lordship. By an open declaration of
engaged affection, which would end all further
hopes on his side, Christobelle's disquietudes
would cease; and her mother would reconcile
herself to a step which must be unavoidable, by
every honourable and upright principle of justice.
Christobelle had no doubts to solve, no
inquiries to make with her own heart. Every
feeling of her soul was given to Sir John Spottiswoode,
and Lord Farnborough had not deserved
to endure suspense. She obeyed her
mother's command, therefore, to meet his lordship
upon the terrace. Her steps were slow,
and her mind was torn with contending feelings,
but she went forward.</p>

<p>"Bell," said Lady Wetheral, as she passed
through the open window, "do not be rash."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough approached with respectful
pleasure. Christobelle returned his greeting
with a silent bow, but she could not command
words, and she stood in silence before him. His
lordship hesitated.</p>

<p>"Miss Wetheral is aware, I presume, of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
hopes?"</p>

<p>"My mother has informed me, my lord, of
your wishes&mdash;of the honour done me, but...."</p>

<p>"Will you do me the honour to walk up the
terrace, Miss Wetheral, while I explain my feelings
and motives." His lordship offered his
arm; Christobelle declined it silently. "I
trust you will not misinterpret my action, Miss
Wetheral. I am not a confident man, or one
who presumes upon a parent's interest in my
behalf&mdash;it was done in all respect, Miss Wetheral."</p>

<p>"I am sure it was so, my lord&mdash;my only motive
for declining your assistance, is the fear of
giving a hope, where none is intended."</p>

<p>His lordship appeared startled and annoyed.</p>

<p>"When I have explained my wishes, Miss
Wetheral, to you, and when I state my hope
that you will allow me to visit you at present,
simply as a friend, till you can give me a dearer
title, I trust you will listen calmly to what I
am further anxious to say."</p>

<p>"Lord Farnborough," replied Christobelle,
with trepidation of voice and manner, "I will
not deceive you for one moment. Pray do not
think of me, for it is useless. I&mdash;I&mdash;cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
love you, or even give you hope that I ever shall
love you. Pray do not think of me."</p>

<p>Lord Farnborough bowed with great stiffness.
"I beg your pardon, Miss Wetheral, for this
annoyance, but, allow me to say, I was assured
you were disengaged."</p>

<p>"My lord, I was&mdash;&mdash;, I am&mdash;&mdash;." The
words died upon Christobelle's tongue; she could
not utter them.</p>

<p>"Ponsonby has made an impression upon
your heart, Miss Wetheral! I thought&mdash;I was
<i>sure</i> of it yesterday! That fellow is born to be
my misery."</p>

<p>Christobelle laid her hand upon his lordship's
arm, and endeavoured to speak distinctly, but
she could only articulate, "No, no, no!"</p>

<p>"Do not fear me, Miss Wetheral," replied
his lordship, with offensive hauteur, "I am not
intending to wreak vengeance upon a man you
approve, but this is the second time he has traversed
me!"</p>

<p>"Captain Ponsonby is nothing to <i>me</i>, my
lord; Captain Ponsonby can never be any thing
to me!" Christobelle exclaimed, "but pray excuse
me if I drop the subject for ever. I am
honoured&mdash;I am flattered&mdash;but it never can be,
Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>His lordship gazed eagerly in her face. "Repeat
those words again, Miss Wetheral! Assure
me again that Ponsonby is, and will be,
nothing to you!"</p>

<p>"I do repeat it, my lord."</p>

<p>"Then, Miss Wetheral, I am content. I
will believe your assertion, and it gives me hope.
Do not be in haste to reply. Allow me your
attention for a few moments."</p>

<p>"I cannot listen, my lord. I have spoken
the truth, and I beg to be allowed to say this
subject must end for ever. I have no affections
to bestow upon yourself, or upon Captain Ponsonby."</p>

<p>"I beseech you to listen one moment&mdash;one
moment, Miss Wetheral! I do not ask for your
affections yet. I could not presume to hope
even for a preference, upon our short acquaintance.
I only pray for leave to visit you&mdash;to try
and interest your heart, by my attentions and
my love. Lady Wetheral gives me hope, Christobelle!"</p>

<p>"No one can give hope for another, my
lord."</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral assures me your heart is
free."</p>

<p>Christobelle hesitated. Why did she feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ashamed to utter the truth, and end at once the
displeasing subject? Why hesitate? She suffered
many struggles between shame and timidity,
but at last the victory was gained, and she
spoke with resolution.</p>

<p>"My lord, I love another&mdash;I have given my
affections to another person&mdash;excuse me."</p>

<p>His lordship bowed low, with peculiar frigidity
of manner. "I wish you good morning,
Miss Wetheral. I regret my intrusion: I am
answered."</p>

<p>Christobelle curtseyed with equal hauteur.</p>

<p>"I am sorry my words have produced dissatisfaction,
my lord. It was but just that my
sentiments should not be misunderstood, and I
do not reproach myself for having withheld an
ungenerous and delusive hope. Good morning,
my lord."</p>

<p>They parted with a second silent and distant
salutation, and Lord Farnborough quitted the
terrace.</p>

<p>Christobelle stood some moments, vainly endeavouring
to gain fortitude to meet her mother&mdash;but
now the deed was done, and his lordship
had departed, the terror of Lady Wetheral's
anger fell upon her heart, and she flew to her
father for protection. Sir John Wetheral was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in his study conversing with Spottiswoode, when
Christobelle appeared, and both gentlemen rose,
smiling at her entrance; but she threw herself
into her father's arms with hurried steps, and
besought him to save her from her mother's reproaches.
She felt it was impossible to meet
her alone, or bear the indignant flashes of her
eye. She implored her father to be the bearer
of her refusal, and to endeavour to soften her
mother's anger, when she learned that Lord
Farnborough was returning to Clanmoray, a rejected
and offended suitor.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral soothed his daughter's
fears with kind approval of her conduct. He
spoke affectionately of her attachment to his
friend, and commended the propriety of her sincere
avowal to Lord Farnborough. He would
leave her now under the soothing care of Spottiswoode,
who was destined, he hoped, to be her
future guide through life. He would give his
Christobelle to his care, to listen to his reasonings
and his affection, while he himself sought
the presence of his lady. He bade his daughter
fear nothing. He would shield her from all the
storms of life, till he relinquished her into a husband's
care. And, while she continued to act
with honourable and high principles, untouched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
by sordid temptations, and the miseries of an insatiable
ambition, she must be free from self-reproach,
and would be patient under trials which
could not greatly affect her peace of mind. Sir
John Wetheral then placed his daughter's hand
within the warm grasp of Spottiswoode, and left
them together.</p>

<p>Lovers' happiness is composed of a million nothings,
and every indescribable rapture, which in
after days provoke the laughter and ridicule of
its votaries. All those who have loved understand
it well&mdash;and to those who have never
known a sincere attachment, it is a sealed book.
Christobelle utterly forgot all mundane concerns,
as she listened to the fond effusions of her lover's
heart, and owned an affection deep and imperious
as his own. Christobelle almost forgot
there was a drop of bitter yet left, in her cup of
joy.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral passed on to his lady's
apartment, little aware of the scene which
awaited his peaceful nature, produced by defeated
ambition, in an ardent spirit. Lady Wetheral
was suffering severe nervous excitation as
he entered her sitting-room, for Christobelle's
protracted absence boded evil to her hopes. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
looked earnestly in her husband's face, to read
its import.</p>

<p>"You have seen Bell, you have seen Bell&mdash;tell
me at once, if I am to be the mother of
Lady Farnborough."</p>

<p>"Gertrude," replied her husband, calmly,
"do not destroy your health by these nervous
excitements."</p>

<p>"Sir John, my nerves are excited by the conduct
of my children. Am I the mother of the
future Duchess of Forfar? Am I to be the
proud mother of a child raised to the very pinnacle
of worldly grandeur?"</p>

<p>"You will be the mother of a child truly
happy in her worldly prospects, if your mind
will but look rationally upon its promises, my
dear Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Am I to be the mother of Lady Farnborough?"
repeated the excited parent.</p>

<p>"Our daughter has not committed the base
folly of accepting one man, when her heart belonged
to another, Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Did <i>I</i> not do so before her, Sir John? I
never repented <i>my</i> marriage!"</p>

<p>"It might be so, my love, but Chrystal never
possessed your ambition, to soar over affection
and honour, through its cold dictates."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I to understand Bell has refused Lord
Farnborough, Sir John? Is that the reading
of your words? Pray speak it in intelligible
words."</p>

<p>"Christobelle has declined his lordship, Gertrude.
Her heart preferred Spottiswoode, and
my concurrence went with it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will convey a message from me
to the future Lady Spottiswoode of Alverton,
among the flat meadows of Worcestershire, Sir
John," replied his lady, in the calm tones of
suppressed anger. "Tell my Lady Spottiswoode
it is my request she never presumes to
appear before me during the days of her singlehood."</p>

<p>"Gertrude, Gertrude," exclaimed her husband,
"is this request a fit message from a mother
to her child?"</p>

<p>"I had always a dislike to scenes," observed
her ladyship, "therefore, I shall not reproach
Miss Wetheral with her deceptive conduct in
allowing attentions from a quarter which I never
countenanced, and after my express commands
to avoid them. I ever deprecated scenes before
Lady Kerrison&mdash;but her violent spirit scorned
restraint. She gave me deep pain; and Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Ennismore's banishment has caused me pain&mdash;but
this stroke lies far deeper in my heart!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral became all nerve: her whole
person was in a nervous trembling. Her husband
failed in every effort to tranquillize her
spirit.</p>

<p>"You may dilate upon the supreme excellence
of your favourite Spottiswoode, my love,
and you may assure me your daughter is an enviable
and a happy being; but I know she has
cast aside a ducal coronet, to wed the poor baronet
of Alverton! I will see her no more. I
will never see her again."</p>

<p>"My dear Gertrude, be tranquil, and be
rational." Sir John Wetheral never could be
persuaded to lose his temper.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly tranquil and calm, Sir John.
I am perfectly tranquil, and very rational in my
commands, when I persist in banishing my unnatural
child from my sight. Miss Wetheral
has taken her measures, and I assert mine. We
do not meet again."</p>

<p>"This is wrong, a wicked wrong, towards an
innocent child, Gertrude!"</p>

<p>"She is very innocent," retorted Lady Wetheral,
with bitterness. "Her innocence has
caused her to oppose my wishes, and to dare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that which her sisters never presumed to do.
They never contravened my views, nor thwarted
my wishes in their establishment, and they
married well!"</p>

<p>"Was it <i>well</i> with Clara?" demanded her
husband, with earnestness of manner as startling
as it was novel&mdash;"was it <i>well</i> with Clara?
Did she not quit her home clandestinely, to become
the wife of Kerrison?&mdash;miserable in her
short career, and sudden in her death, was she
happy? Is Clara to be held forth as an evidence
of maternal care, in such a momentous
concern?"</p>

<p>"Forbear, Sir John, forbear!" cried his lady.</p>

<p>"Nay, but Gertrude, has it been well with
Julia, whom you taught to fly at quarry so distasteful?
Wedded to imbecility&mdash;banished
from her home and country, unseen and unheard
of&mdash;is she, too, an evidence of your talent in contriving
establishments?"</p>

<p>"I tell you," exclaimed her ladyship, "Julia
is an earl's wife; and Clara's position was high
and grandly placed, but her own hand plucked
her down. Who can reproach <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"I will not reproach you, Gertrude, but I
counsel you to spare this last poor child. Remember
only your fatal mistakes, and do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
add a third victim. I will not allow Christobelle
to be sacrificed to your ambition."</p>

<p>"Ring for Bevan, I am very ill&mdash;ring for
Bevan, but let no one else come near me. I
am <i>not</i> hard-hearted! Clara called me hard-hearted:
I am not hard-hearted! I am a disappointed,
deceived mother. Where is Bevan?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bevan appeared with the remedies, which
time had taught her to dispense as judiciously
as her predecessor, Mrs. Daniel Higgins, had
done; but Lady Wetheral's attack threatened
a longer continuance than usual. She would
fain have retired to her own room, but Sir John
perceived her inability to move without assistance:
her ladyship trembled excessively. He
bore her in his arms to her bed-side, and Mrs.
Bevan, after assisting her lady to repose, proceeded
to close the shutters, and exclude the
bright sunbeams. Lady Wetheral became still
more nervous.</p>

<p>"Bevan, let me have light&mdash;let me have
light! If I cannot see the sun, it will be darkness
of body and mind. Don't leave me, Bevan.
Sir John, where are you?"</p>

<p>Sir John stood near, in a state of offended
alarm: his mind was discomposed&mdash;it never became
angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir John, I cannot remain at Fairlee: take
me back to Wetheral. Bell has destroyed my
health. I was quite well till this wretched
match, which has destroyed all my plans, and
thrown down all my hopes! It has made me
ill&mdash;worse than ever!"</p>

<p>It was not in the power of reason, much less
in Sir John Wetheral's power, to check the indignant
feelings which affected his lady's mind
upon the subject of Lord Farnborough's refusal.
Each attempt to argue away their violence did
but increase the evil. Nothing could induce her
ladyship to receive Christobelle at her bed-side,
or hear a word pleaded in her defence. Christobelle's
attachment to Sir John Spottiswoode,
and her subsequent refusal to accept Lord
Farnborough's proposal, appeared to destroy the
ties of affection which had never been closely
woven together, for his ladyship declared her
daughter's presence would kill her upon the
spot. The sad event which occasioned her
flight from England, faded under the shock of
Lord Farnborough's dismissal. Scotland would
be to her sickened heart a remembrance of
misery. Either Christobelle or herself must
quit the shores of the now desolate and cold
Lochleven, upon whose bosom she had once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
enjoyed such bright anticipations. All was
ended, and joy had closed her brilliant wings
for ever. This was an irrecoverable stroke.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral did not conceal from
Christobelle the mandate which banished her
from her mother's presence; and the consolation
of Spottiswoode's presence was indeed necessary
to soothe her distress of heart. Christobelle
would cheerfully have contributed to her
parent's comfort, had her wishes extended to
less than the sacrifice of all happiness; but
surely it was not reprehensible to withhold
a shadow of hope, when her heart was not with
Lord Farnborough! Surely it was not right to
turn from the man she loved, when her affections
were his beyond the power of recal, and when
the voice of ambition alone demanded it! True,
Julia and Clara's views were moulded by her
mother's spirit, but then their hearts were untouched,
and their unshackled affections might
submit to her dictation. Ambition also impelled
them to meet her wishes, and no private
feeling struggled within their soul to deaden
its influence; but Christobelle was another's!&mdash;she
might suffer, but she could not change!</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode believed that time
would soften Lady Wetheral's displeasure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Christobelle knew too well the bitterness of the
disappointment, to lay such unction to her soul.
Had she ever been a favourite with her ladyship&mdash;had
her youth been pleasant in her sight,
she might have hoped to obtain an influence
through the operation of time, sufficient to
effect a reconciliation in favour of her present
attachment. But that had never been the case.
Her birth was considered out of time&mdash;her sex
displeased her&mdash;her education was uninteresting
to her mother's mind. It was only at intervals,
and under particular circumstances,
that Christobelle received any commendation,
and it expired with the cause which elicited its
birth. Christobelle felt assured her mother
would never forgive the wound inflicted upon
her ambition. She felt assured her mother
would never forgive the dismissal of Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral decided upon quitting
Fairlee as soon as his lady felt equal to undertake
the fatigue of a journey; and he also expressed
a wish that a twelvemonth should elapse
ere Christobelle became the wife of Spottiswoode.
"His daughter," he said, "was young,
and a twelvemonth might effect a change in her
mother's feelings. It was Christobelle's duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to make some concessions to an offended parent,
and twelvemonths would operate as a fair trial
of the constancy of her own nature."</p>

<p>Christobelle submitted most willingly to this
arrangement. The least wish of her father had
ever been her rule of conduct, and his indulgence
would have won obedience, had his wishes
extended the period of the engagement. But
Sir John required no painful sacrifices, no
useless trials. Spottiswoode might visit Christobelle
whenever his avocations enabled him to
become a guest at Lidham, and he trusted time
would soften Lady Wetheral's disappointed
views. He dared not pronounce upon its certainty,
but they had a right to hope the best.</p>

<p>The continued mortification which embittered
Christobelle's repose, by Lady Wetheral's harsh
mandate, at last induced Sir John to resolve
upon his daughter quitting Fairlee. It was a
painful and perpetual grievance to Christobelle,
to know that her mother was ill, and confined
to her apartments, yet that <i>she</i> was not suffered
to alleviate her confinement, or attend her. It
was a grief which the affectionate attentions of
her lover could not control, and which her
father's soothing presence did not lessen. Her
appetite declined and her spirits fled. Spottiswoode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
also became dispirited and uneasy in
witnessing her regrets, and Sir John Wetheral,
alarmed at his daughter's increasing depression,
wrote to Mr. Boscawen to meet them at Edinburgh,
and conduct Christobelle to his own
home for a season.</p>

<p>It was judged, that absence from a scene so
painful, and the society of Isabel, would cheer
her spirits, and soften her present sorrow; while,
under the protection of Mr. Boscawen, she
might receive the visits of Sir John Spottiswoode,
and move among the friends she loved,
and whom she had not seen for some years.
Spottiswoode would remain some time longer
at Fairlee, and it might be, that his lengthened
sojourn in the north would produce a favourable
effect upon the invalid's mind. It might be,
that the knowledge of her daughter's withdrawal
would rouse her, and if any human being could
amuse and soften a harsh determination in Lady
Wetheral's soul, that being was the good and
kind Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>Christobelle wandered each day with her
lover through the scenes of their early walks,
and if the exercise failed to bring the bloom
into her cheek, yet she was happy while leaning
on his arm, and listening to his hopes. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
spoke of Alverton in the rocky bower which
she was so soon to quit. Christobelle looked
upon the water, and she thought of the years of
careless freedom in which she had wandered
among those beautiful scenes with Janet for her
sole companion. She thought of the Douglas
Isle, where she had first seen Lord Farnborough,
and the spot from whence she had waved her
plaid at their parting. Christobelle thought
of her gradually increasing passion for Spottiswoode&mdash;the
hopes and fears of St. Mungo's
Isle&mdash;the pangs of jealous feelings which she
endured when Fanny Ponsonby engrossed the
attention of him she loved:&mdash;she thought, too,
of her present situation, the betrothed of Spottiswoode,
yet the banished one from her mother's
side. Would that mother, indeed, continue to
drive her child from her presence, or might she
yet receive her smile and hear her welcome?
Should she be indeed the happy wife of Spottiswoode,
and become, as he fondly styled her,
the bright star of Alverton? Christobelle wept.
Spottiswoode pressed her to his heart.</p>

<p>"My own Chrystal, this silent grief destroys
me, for it is through me you suffer. Would to
Heaven you were safe at Brierly with your
friends, and that I was with you! I shall soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
follow you, for here I cannot remain without
you. I should hear you sigh, and see your
weeping figure in every spot where we have been
together. I shall look like the ghost of departed
Pleasure. You will leave me on Friday,
my Chrystal."</p>

<p>"For a few days only, Spottiswoode."</p>

<p>"I shall know you are in kind protection,
dearest. You will be with the best of men in
Boscawen's company, and you love him as well
as Isabel. Her children will amuse you. You
will see the Pynsents. You will hardly have
time to think of <i>me</i>, Chrystal."</p>

<p>"I will try to forget you sometimes; I
wonder if I shall succeed."</p>

<p>"You have nephews and nieces to engross
your attention; you will be joked by Mrs. Pynsent,
Chrystal, for fancying your poor lover.
Every body will crowd round you, to admire
your loveliness, and wonder at your graceful
figure; and yet I must not be there to witness
it. What shall <i>I</i> do without you?"</p>

<p>The tears sprung to Chrystal's eyes; she endeavoured
to disperse them, but they fell unbidden.
Her mind was weakened by recent
events. She clasped her hands, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, do not say you will suffer, Spottiswoode,
by my absence."</p>

<p>"No, no, my love," he replied, with fond endearments,
"I will not think of our little trial.
You will go from me on Friday; but are you
not my own betrothed bride, and are we not
one in heart and hand? You will rejoice your
friends, and be rejoiced in meeting them. I
shall also rejoice, in the knowledge of your
happiness. Our thoughts will meet often and
often in our absence; and then, my Chrystal,
we shall meet again in peace. I cannot and
will not remain a week absent from you."</p>

<p>Christobelle smiled again to think their separation
was not eternal. How many attached
hearts had been torn asunder, while they were
mourning over the parting of a few short days!
How many hearts had bid a long farewell, while
they should meet again and be in peace! Again
she leaned against her lover's shoulder, and her
thoughts were of grateful thanks. She was not
called to severe affliction&mdash;she was not beloved
by a man whose birth or character was repugnant
to her friends, and to whom her happiness was
a source of discomfort and disgust. Even her
mother had not deprecated Spottiswoode: his
offence in her eyes arose from having won her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
daughter from Lord Farnborough. Her father
loved him, and approved her attachment. Yes,
Christobelle had reason to be thankful to the
hand which ministered so wisely for her happiness.
Her mother would not always be harsh;
surely she might in time be summoned into her
presence! She would never be forgiven; she
never <i>had</i> been loved; and the slight cord of
affection was broken for ever between them:
but they might meet without pain, she hoped,
on her mother's part; and she herself would
exert unceasing efforts to win her into complacency.
Her mother <i>must</i> love Spottiswoode,
when time should soften her remembrance of
Lord Farnborough's attentions.</p>

<p>Christobelle spoke of Fanny Ponsonby to her
companion, now that her heart was at rest; and
alluded to her emotions in St. Mungo's Isle.
Spottiswoode had, from the first hour of their
introduction, discovered her predilection for
Lord Farnborough.</p>

<p>"I could trace it, Chrystal, in the agitated
and close attention she bestowed upon yourself,
and in her anxiety to remove from your vicinity.
I saw the distressed feelings of her heart, as she
watched the engrossed attention of Farnborough
at dinner: and I felt for her sufferings during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the singing. I felt for her and for myself at
that moment, Chrystal, for I also fancied you
approved his lordship."</p>

<p>"How could you think so, Spottiswoode?"</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral's words were in my ears,
Chrystal, and I had relinquished all hope for
myself."</p>

<p>"What a day of misery it was to me!" Christobelle
exclaimed, as she thought of all she had
endured. "Fanny Ponsonby's feelings were all
echoed by my own."</p>

<p>"It was a painful day to many, Chrystal; but
to us it has proved a blessing, for it confessed our
sentiments at once, and prepared the way for
our mutual understanding. Had you not expressed
disapprobation of Lord Farnborough, I
had not dared to tell my feelings. Was it not a
blessing, my love?"</p>

<p>"But poor Fanny Ponsonby, what will be <i>her</i>
destiny?" Christobelle asked, as she returned
the pressure of Spottiswoode's hand. "What
will be her fate in her attachment?"</p>

<p>"Miss Ponsonby has sown her seed among
thorns," he replied, with feeling, "and her heart
must wrestle with its feelings, unless she becomes
his wife. Lord Farnborough may turn to Miss
Ponsonby, since you have rejected him, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
may become the envied Lady Farnborough; but
she will only sink into a neglected wife. He
cannot make a woman happy."</p>

<p>"Oh! if I had seen him with my mother's
eyes, and fallen a sacrifice!" observed Christobelle,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"I should have quitted England, Chrystal. I
would not have witnessed your misery, or remained
within hearing of your gradual decay.
You could not long live under his harsh treatment,
and I could not have borne to hear the world
remark upon your pale cheek and faded form."</p>

<p>"How grateful I am! how happy I ought to
be, Spottiswoode! When you come to see me at
Brierly, and I do not suffer daily under my
mother's angry prohibition, you will find me
so changed and happy! When I think of Lord
Farnborough, I turn to you with such grateful
delight! Yes, Spottiswoode, I <i>will</i> be happy!"</p>

<p>And Christobelle exerted herself to be happy,
even the few days which intervened between her
expressed gratitude and her long farewell to
Fairlee. She sat hour after hour upon the terrace,
with her father and Spottiswoode, looking
with deep interest upon the lake, the scene of
all her pleasures, while she was happy in ignorance
of a deep affection, and the scene of suffering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
during the stirring incidents which had
awakened her heart to the strife of worldly sorrow.
Lochleven was endeared to Christobelle by a
thousand recollections, by the enjoyments of her
young age, and by the happy hours passed by
the side of Spottiswoode. She was going to the
south, to a new scene that would be changed in
its aspect; gayer, full of friends, and still blest
by the society of him she loved. But would it
be to her like the grand Lochleven?&mdash;that
shelter from the world's cares? that spot where
she had enjoyed such long tranquillity? Adieu
for a long, long time, the cloud-capped mountains,
the heather hills, the placid waters! farewell
the islands on its bosom&mdash;the groves,
the far Cona! Farewell the stirring breeze, the
lonely Eilan na Corak&mdash;the repose, the grandeur
of the shores of Lochleven!</p>

<p>Christobelle endured much, ere she set forth
with her father from Fairlee. She bore her
parting interview with Spottiswoode with great
intrepidity; but she wept at her mother's obdurate
determination not to see her before she
quitted the parental roof. Sir John Wetheral
soothed her as she gazed upon the lake, till it
vanished from her aching sight: and he prophesied
that her trial would not be lengthened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
beyond her power to endure it. He spoke kindly
and well to her overpowered spirit, of the sorrows
which must accompany a progress through
life, and of the consolation which attended a
patient and praying spirit. He did not consider
it right to allow Spottiswoode to accompany
them, as her mother evinced such decided repugnance
to the match; but at Brierly, Christobelle
might enjoy her lover's society in peace;
and he would accompany his lady to Wetheral
as soon as she expressed a wish to set forth on
the long journey. New scenes, new faces, and
a new set of ideas would, he hoped, drive gloomy
fancies from her mind, and bring comfort to all
parties. She was on her road to Isabel, and
with her and Boscawen she must enjoy the calm
pleasures of domestic happiness. They would
lead her to agreeable thoughts, and Spottiswoode
would speedily add his society to the enjoyments
of Brierly.</p>

<p>Such was Sir John Wetheral's reasoning, and
its effects were apparent upon Christobelle's
spirits. She gradually recovered cheerfulness
under his indulgent soothings, and she could
even admire the changing scenery which varied
their route to Edinburgh. Mr. Boscawen was
true to his appointment; they found him at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
place of rendezvous, ready to conduct Christobelle
to the county of her birth, and induct her
once more into the domicile which had sheltered
her so kindly years before.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen was surprised at her growth,
and wondered at the girl who had glided into
womanhood so rapidly. He thought her features
bore a strong resemblance to her unfortunate
sister Clara; but he politely assured her, her
manner was entirely her own. She was no
longer, he said, "the gay little half-grown girl,
who had delighted to nurse her nephew under
the mulberry tree at Brierly. She must be
looked upon in a very different phase; and he
feared the quiet haunts of Brierly would ring
with the charms of the beautiful Miss Wetheral.
He was pleased to think she possessed a protector
whose claims would at once put an end
to the fearful contention of furious rivals." Christobelle's
blushes were the only answers she could
give to the agreeable remarks of Mr. Boscawen.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral's absence would not be of
long continuance, therefore Christobelle did not
sorrow much as she bade him adieu. She prayed
him to speak of her to her mother, and to express
her deepest regret at having incurred her
displeasure. She prayed for her pardon, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
they might meet again in reconciliation. She
looked to her forgiveness with anxious desire,
with a fervent and unceasing hope. She embraced
her dear father, and bade him remember
her kindly, affectionately, to the friend she had
left at Fairlee, and then she gave her hand to
Mr. Boscawen.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>


<p>How delightedly did the eye of Christobelle
rest upon the matronly form of Isabel! She was
clasped in her arms, as she descended the steps
of the chaise at Brierly.</p>

<p>"Well, I never saw such a beautiful creature
in my life! My dear Christobelle, who would
have thought you would turn out so very pretty?
My dear Mr. Boscawen, were you not surprised
at Christobelle's beauty, when you first saw her?"</p>

<p>"I was not so overcome at your sister's handsome
face, as I am astonished at Isabel's neglect
of her long-absent husband," replied Mr. Boscawen,
smiling. Isabel flew towards him.</p>

<p>"I can't think how I came to be so wicked;
but, indeed, it was the sight of my sister's face.
My dear Boscawen, I have so longed for your
return, and so have the children! I was obliged
to tell the dear things papa was gone a long way
off, for some cakes and their pretty aunt, or they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
would not have been comforted. I did not know
what hour you would arrive, therefore I was
wise enough not to say a word to them about it."</p>

<p>"They shall be summoned after dinner, Isabel.
We are hungry travellers now, and a meal
will be most gratefully welcomed."</p>

<p>"My love, ring the bell, and order it in now,
if you please, while I escort my sister to her
room. Follow me, dear Christobelle. Well, I
declare I never saw such a change in a human
being! You are tall and handsome, and have such
beautiful ringlets! I shall certainly have ringlets
too. I can't fancy you are the little, jumping
Chrystal, who was dressed out so fine at my
wedding, five or six years ago. Well&mdash;and
don't you think <i>I</i> am changed?"</p>

<p>Isabel was changed. Her sylph-like figure
had swelled into a stout form: her waist had
increased materially in breadth, and her dress
was rather disordered.</p>

<p>"The children are so playful, Chrystal, that
my collars have always a ragged appearance;
and corsets of any kind are so very painful, because
I am getting large, that I never wear them.
Boscawen, though, does not mind my appearance:
he is not particular. He allows me to do
just what I like, and I am so happy! Ah! do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
you remember my geography days, Chrystal?
How I detested that dreadful map of the world!
I am determined my little Bell shall be happy
and ignorant, as I was before her. She is called
Bell after you, dear&mdash;not your long name, but
simply Bell. I hope she will be as pretty as
you; but what does it signify? Who can be
happier than I am, with my broad waist and
rumpled collars?"</p>

<p>The moment the servants had withdrawn, after
dessert was placed upon the table, Isabel continued
her happy prattle.</p>

<p>"I have so much to tell you, of one kind
or the other, dear Bell, that I don't know where
to begin. What shall I tell first, my dear Boscawen?
Oh! Bell, such things are whispered
of Julia!&mdash;I don't believe a word of them&mdash;not
one word. However, you will find Anna Maria
more French than ever, for the Count de Nolis
has been staying every Christmas at Hatton, and
Flic does lay on the rouge terribly. It's
quite amusing to hear Tom Pynsent boast of his
wife's bloom, when it's rouge all the time. I
think I wrote you word, that odd Mrs. Hancock
had a paralytic stroke some time ago?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Isabel, I never heard of it."</p>

<p>"Didn't you? Oh! it's the case, I assure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
you&mdash;her mouth is all on one side. Poor Miss
Tabitha is not dead yet, Bell: I don't think she
means to die at all; and Mrs. Ward writes word,
she finds fault with every thing, poor soul, that
is said or done. Shall I ring for the darlings,
my dear Boscawen? I am sure Chrystal is dying
to see her little boy, whom she nursed so
carefully. Ring the bell twice, my love, and the
little wild things will soon rush in."</p>

<p>"Do not give Tom wine, Isabel; I have a dislike
to children taking wine so early in life."</p>

<p>"No, my dear Boscawen, certainly not. I
think, with you, that wine is very improper for
children&mdash;but little Tom has such a winning
way of coaxing his poor mother!"</p>

<p>The children soon burst into the room, and
ran bounding round the table. Isabel was all
triumphant pleasure. "Now, Charles&mdash;my dear
Charles, go quietly to papa, and ask him how he
does, and whether the cakes are come from merry
Scotland. Ah, ha, Charley goes for his cakes.
Tom, my beauty, come to mamma; and Bell, go
to your aunt&mdash;your new aunt, and admire her
pretty hair."</p>

<p>Christobelle endeavoured to attract her little
fat niece to her side, but she hid her face in
Isabel's lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Bell, I'm ashamed of you!&mdash;your pretty
aunt, too&mdash;oh, fie! My dear Tommy, don't
touch mamma's glass. No, no wine, Tommy&mdash;papa
says no. A few strawberries, my dear
little boy, and a biscuit, but no wine."</p>

<p>Tommy, however, advanced his mother's wineglass
to his lips, watching her countenance with
a cunning glance.</p>

<p>"Now, my little, good Tommy, mamma will
be angry, very angry, if you do what she tells
you not to do. Bell, my love, go to your aunt,
like a good girl."</p>

<p>Isabel took some pains to persuade her little
girl to raise her head, but her appeals were useless.
In the mean time, Tommy had silently
quaffed the remainder of the contents of her
glass. Mr. Boscawen rose, and took him from
Isabel's knee.</p>

<p>"My dear Boscawen, what are you going to
do with Tommy? he is very good with me, my
love."</p>

<p>"I am going to banish him, Isabel, for disobedience."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Boscawen, it was the least
little drop of wine in the world! it was scarcely
a teaspoonful&mdash;pray don't punish Tommy for
that little drop, my love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"The disobedience was the same in the action,
Isabel. I shall send him into the nursery. I
shall take him there myself."</p>

<p>Isabel's eyes suffused, as Mr. Boscawen left
the dining-room with the crying recreant Tommy.
She turned to her sister.</p>

<p>"Oh! Chrystal, was it not severe to carry
away that dear child, for one drop of wine only?"</p>

<p>"Boscawen was quite right, my dear Isabel."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so? Do you really
think he was right to banish the darling child,
when it was such a pretty, coaxing trick? Did
you see his little, cunning, dear eyes?"</p>

<p>"Boscawen justly thinks, Isabel, that cunning
habits and disobedience will increase, if it is not
checked."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope it won't increase&mdash;dear child&mdash;I
should be sorry to see him grow sly." Mr.
Boscawen returned. "My love, did Tommy
cry? Was he very much hurt&mdash;poor dear?
Did you leave him crying?"</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, you have brought this upon
him, by not checking disobedience in the first
instance. You have allowed the child twice to
steal your wine."</p>

<p>"My dear Boscawen&mdash;steal! indeed, that
sounds dreadful! I hope my children will never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
steal! It was indeed my fault! Poor, dear
child!&mdash;I dare say he is crying dreadfully now.
Let me beg for my child, Boscawen."</p>

<p>"Let him remain where he is, Isabel: he has
been very naughty."</p>

<p>"But I have taught him to steal, and I ought
to suffer for him, dear Boscawen. Let me go
to my child, my love!" The tears stood in Isabel's
eyes, and Boscawen was still under their
influence. He soothed his lady as fondly as
when in earlier days she wept for the drooping
ostrich feather.</p>

<p>"My dear Isabel, when we retire into the
drawing-room, your child shall come down again.
Don't weep, my love. I cannot wonder at your
fondness, but he was very naughty. Wait a few
moments, Isabel, and the child shall join us in
the drawing-room. Don't let me see you weep&mdash;stay,
I will bring him down to you."</p>

<p>Isabel smiled, and little Tommy was restored to
her arms, as he entered the drawing-room. Mr.
Boscawen felt he had acted unwisely by his
child; but how could he resist Isabel in tears?
Things were totally changed at Brierly. A
tear from the bright blue eye of Isabel melted
Boscawen's best resolves, and operated against
the excellence of his own system of education.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Isabel held the reins of government in her hands.
She never argued with her husband&mdash;she never
offered a word of opposition to his wishes&mdash;but
she ruled by submission, and won his acquiescence
by her tears and gentle self-upbraidings. Fortunately,
her children possessed her own sweet
disposition, which defied indulgence, or they
might have suffered through Isabel's inability to
check their budding faults. As it was, they
loved her too well to persist in offending a parent
so devoted; and it must have proved a very
serious offence, ere the light-hearted Isabel could
lament conduct which was ever palliated by her
affectionate heart. She was indeed the happiest
of wives and mothers.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen and Christobelle resumed their
occupations instinctively, as if years had not intervened
since they last walked and read together
at Brierly. Isabel was delighted.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you go again!&mdash;read, read, talk,
talk, all day long. I like to hear you argue,
when I have time to devote to you both; but the
children require so much attention, and the dear
little things love to be with me so often, that dear
Boscawen has been a great deal alone, haven't
you, Boscawen? It is such a pleasure to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
you here, Chrystal&mdash;my poor, dear husband won't
have to endure my ignorance."</p>

<p>"Who says my Isabel is ignorant?" said Mr.
Boscawen, patting his lady's shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Boscawen, I am very ignorant, and
very unfit for you; but I do very well to play
with the darlings, and superintend every thing
but their education&mdash;<i>that</i> you will do, except for
poor little Bell: let her be happy and ignorant,
Boscawen. If she is half as happy as her mother,
she will not require knowledge&mdash;only her husband
and children. I never wish for any thing
beyond you and them." Isabel cast an upward
and affectionate look at Boscawen, who bent his
long figure to kiss his laughing wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen told Christobelle he had engaged
to take her for a day or two to Hatton. The
Pynsents were very anxious to see her, and Mrs.
Pynsent had made it a point with him to bring
the "tall, gawky, good-looking girl" to her, as
soon as she had rested a few days at Brierly.
The Charles Spottiswoodes, also, were wishing to
see her again, to contemplate the improvement
which five years must have effected in her appearance.
The name of Spottiswoode brought blushes
into the face of Christobelle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Bell," exclaimed Isabel, with laughing
delight, "how droll it is to think you have a
lover; when I saw you last, you were such a bit
of a girl! Sir John Spottiswoode is just the
man I would have chosen for you&mdash;just the very
person I should have singled out&mdash;is he not, Boscawen?&mdash;just
the sort of man, with curling dark
hair and high forehead, that you ought to like,
dear Chrystal!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> had not dark curling hair, Isabel?" said
Boscawen, smiling&mdash;"I had not a high forehead,
had I?"</p>

<p>"My dear Boscawen, your hair was always
dreadfully wiry, and I thought you very plain,
but I liked you for all that, you know."</p>

<p>"Then why <i>ought</i> Chrystal to choose and love
such things, my Isabel?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I dare say I am talking nonsense again,"
cried the humble Isabel, "for I should really recommend
no one who does not resemble you,
dear Boscawen. I should advise every woman
to wait till they could find a kind, dear man, like
yourself, and then they would not care about
wiry hair, or...." Isabel hesitated and coloured.</p>

<p>"Say on, Isabel." Mr. Boscawen looked
amused.</p>

<p>"I was going to say, they would not mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
great long legs. Don't be angry, my love, with
me."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen laughed. "You see, Isabel,
the triumph of good sense over mere personal
advantages. You cannot be ignorant, since you
chose me in spite of my deficiencies. I hope all
your young acquaintance may exhibit your indifference
to mere good looks. Miss Wetheral,
when shall we visit Hatton? Isabel, will you
join the party?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could drive over with you, my love;
but Charly is cutting a double-tooth, and I think
little Bell is not quite well. I think I cannot
leave my little ones two days, Boscawen!"</p>

<p>"Then Chrystal and myself will depart to-morrow
for Hatton," said Boscawen, smiling,
with gratified feelings, at his wife's love of her
home and her little ones.</p>

<p>"Yes, Bell will amuse you, dear Boscawen,
and you will not miss <i>me</i>. You can talk away
upon history and the arts and sciences, and
enjoy the novelty of a clever companion, for
once. I am only fit to nurse my children."</p>

<p>"You are only fit to be a very excellent creature,
and to be my dear little roundabout wife,"
exclaimed Boscawen; and Isabel looked so happy!
It was delightful to witness the joyous expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which revelled in her looks, whenever she spoke
with her husband and children. It was such a
contrast to the Isabel whom Christobelle remembered,
low-spirited, in her dressing-room at Wetheral,
pining over "Burnet's Reformation!" It
was such a contrast to the Isabel who watched in
alarm the fond, but searching, glance of her excellent,
elderly husband!&mdash;Christobelle told her
so, when they were alone. She laughed.</p>

<p>"I remember, Bell, how frightened I used to
be, and there was no cause for it! Boscawen
was always kind, only I was so unwilling to
receive improvement, and then I fancied his
anxiety was annoying. When Miss Tabitha left
Brierly, every thing was comfortable to me; for
then, you know, there was no one to point out
my faults. But, Chrystal, tell me now all about
John Spottiswoode. Boscawen told me not to
be curious, but I am <i>very</i> curious. I want to
know how it all began, and why mamma is so
foolish about Lord Farnborough."</p>

<p>Christobelle recapitulated her story to Isabel,
who wondered, and was pleased, and wept, by
turns, as her sister recounted all her sufferings.
She clasped her arms round Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Chrystal, never mind; and
every thing will end as it should do. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
body knows mamma's matches have turned out
shockingly; and John Spottiswoode is so loved
by all his relations, so good to his mother and
sister, that you are fortunate in attracting him;
but you are so very handsome, dear Chrystal,
you would attract every one, high and low.
People are now scandalizing poor Julia, and
pointing at her and Colonel Neville; but I will
never believe that Julia would do wrong, though
I dare say she is very unhappy, poor dear girl."</p>

<p>"What does Boscawen think, Isabel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Boscawen never thought <i>that</i> match
would answer. He did not like the Dowager's
manners and character; and he said to me, at
Julia's wedding, that if my sister fell from her
high estate, the two mothers would answer for
it hereafter. He said, too, that Julia was the
victim of two machinating Machiavels. Of
course, he meant mamma and the Dowager.
Lord Selgrave was always disliked as a cruel,
disagreeable boy, I hear; so he would have
made you a sad husband, in spite of being Earl
of Farnborough, and a trumpery Duke in expectancy."</p>

<p>Isabel's remarks only corroborated the observations
of Spottiswoode, and Christobelle
believed herself indeed saved from ruin, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
she paid a severe penalty for her escape, in the
angry prohibition of her mother's disappointed
views. Her present pain, she felt assured, was
far more bearable than the misery of an unhappy
matrimony; and she was grateful beyond expression
to know that she was given to a man, so loved
and so well appreciated as Spottiswoode was,
among her nearest friends. Their approbation
must be balm to her heart; and, when her mother
heard how all lips concurred to praise him,
would she continue her ungenerous dislike to her
presence? Would she persist in holding back her
consent, and still pertinaciously revenge upon her
head her dismissal of a man so little respected as
Lord Farnborough? Christobelle hoped not in
fear and trembling; she <i>would</i> hope. As her
dear father observed, she had a right to hope
that her prayers would be heard and answered,
if she persevered in the path of principle.</p>

<p>Christobelle's spirits were considerably improved,
by viewing the happy lot of Isabel, in
the enjoyment of those tranquil domestic scenes
which were so adapted to her taste and nature.
In Mr. Boscawen, she met the highly-informed
mind which imparted knowledge with a flow so
gentle, that it did not startle or confound the
listening neophite. His was a mind which fertilized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
as it stole along, improving all, and
delighting every ear, but the ear of Isabel. To
her the stream of his intellect flowed by, without
a wish to understand, or kindle under its influence,
one spark of sympathetic fire. Yet she
gloried in her husband, and their life was peaceful
and happy.</p>

<p>It is temper which creates the bliss of home,
or disturbs its comfort. It is not in the collision
of intellect, that domestic peace loves to nestle.
Her home is in the forbearing nature&mdash;in the
yielding spirit&mdash;in the calm pleasures of a mild
disposition, anxious to give and receive happiness.
In the sweet humility of Isabel, and in
the indulgent forbearance of Boscawen, peace
dwelt undisturbed by rival animosity; and she
did not suffer those alarms which chase her timid
presence from the hearth of the contentious, and
from the bosom of the envious. Such was the
blessed comfort and true charm of Brierly.</p>

<p>Isabel was all bustle and kindness, as her husband
and sister prepared to depart for Hatton.
"Had dear Boscawen forgotten his shaving-apparatus?&mdash;his
tooth-brush? Was he sure he
had his eye-glass? She hoped they would return
very soon; but, at any rate, till they made
their appearance again, she should live in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
nursery. Dear Boscawen was to be sure and
remember every thing that was said of Chrystal,
for she was sure every one would admire
her pretty face; and Chrystal was particularly
to be amused with Tom Pynsent's remarks upon
Anna Maria's borrowed bloom. Where was
Charly and Bell? They had begged to ride as
far as the Lodges, and she would put on her hat
and meet them."</p>

<p>Isabel ran off to the nursery, and returned
with her three children. Tommy was a soldier,
and a drum was appended to his neck. Charly
had a new fiddle in his hand, and little Bell was
sorted with a trumpet, that she might approach
as nearly as possible to her brother's style of
amusements. Isabel placed them in the carriage.
"Now, Charly and Tommy, don't make a great
noise; and don't snatch your sister's trumpet
from her, my loves. Papa will put you out at
the Lodge, and mamma will be ready to take
you. Charly, don't squeeze your aunt's pretty
dress; and, Bell, my love, don't push back your
bonnet&mdash;I don't like to see little girls push back
their bonnet. Chrystal, give my love to every
body, and say I could not leave the little ones;
I should have done nothing but think of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
My dear Boscawen, come back very soon; and,
Chrystal, don't stay long."</p>

<p>"Any thing more, Isabel?" demanded Boscawen.
"Any thing about curled heads and
high foreheads?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you are laughing at me, now, wicked
man! I believe I talk a great deal of nonsense,
but little Bell will not have her mother's infirmities,
I hope."</p>

<p>"I hope she will possess all of them," replied
Boscawen, "and only inherit half her mother's
sweet temper. She will then have enough to
raise my pride."</p>

<p>Isabel laughed gaily, and blushed at her husband's
energetic speech; but she kissed her
hand, with such a happy expression of countenance,
as they drove from the door! How
pleasing was the sight, and how it tended to
raise the spirits of Christobelle!</p>

<p>The children did not make more noise than
usual, as they drove to the Lodge; and little
Bell only lost her trumpet and her temper once,
during the transit. They were then deposited
with the Lodge-keeper till their mamma should
join them, and Mr. Boscawen proceeded on his
journey. They stopped to change horses at Bridgnorth,
and, as they remained some minutes at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the Crown, Christobelle remembered the appearance
of Thompson, at her first visit there, and
the cause of her sudden recal home. It was
after the luckless elopement of Clara, that she
was hurried to Wetheral, to be the companion
of her mother, under circumstances most annoying
to herself, connected with the very marriage
she had promoted so anxiously. Christobelle
was now herself the object of her anger, for declining
to enter into an engagement, hateful to
her heart and principles! How and when would
her mother's soul be divested of its ambitious
worldly anxieties?</p>

<p>Christobelle's reception at Hatton was gratifying
to her feelings in the highest degree.
She was surrounded by affectionate greetings
and congratulations. Mrs. Pynsent wrung her
hand with kind violence.</p>

<p>"Hollo, Miss Bell, so we have got you back
again, and I won't ask where Sir Jacky is, because
and because. Got your blushes still, Miss
Bell! So much the better&mdash;and I'll be bound
you have brought back your good heart. No,
not your heart, but your good temper. Here,
Bobby, come and look at our new beauty. I
tell you what, Miss Bell, you are a finer girl
than any of your sisters; not even that unfortunate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
poor Lady Kerrison came up to you in
good looks."</p>

<p>"Come, come, I'll match my little wife with
the best of you," exclaimed Tom, more good-humoured,
more red-faced than ever. "I'll
match my little wife's bloom even against the
handsome 'Bell.' Bell's fine colour comes and
fades away again in an instant; but Anna Maria's
cherry cheeks are everlasting. Look at
them!" Tom Pynsent dragged his laughing wife
before Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," replied Mrs. Pynsent, winking her
eye, "we know Anna Maria's bloom is the right
sort&mdash;renewable at pleasure. Look at Bobby,
screwing up his eyes.&mdash;What's the matter,
Bobby?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pynsent never did, and never could appear
to advantage, under the ridicule which his
lady's address always threw around him; but
he did not observe the <i>de haut en bas</i> manner,
or else long custom had taken away all feeling
upon the extraordinary nature of her remarks.
Probably he had long felt assured the evil was
irremediable. His own manner was very courteous,
but Mr. Pynsent was not a man of many
words. He surrendered all speech quietly into
the hands of his lady, and contented himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
with silently listening to the remarks of others,
without adventuring his own. Mr. Pynsent
took no notice of her question.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bobby?" repeated Mrs.
Pynsent. "Can't you admire Miss Bell, without
screwing up your poor old pair of greys? It's a
fair face to look upon, isn't it, after gazing upon
poor Sal. Miss Bell, poor Sally Hancock is in
a precious pickle."</p>

<p>"I heard of it from Isabel."</p>

<p>"You never saw such a poor thing!&mdash;all over
with Sal, Miss Bell; but the poor creature is so
cast down! She has a room here now, to be
amused by the children, and watch their antics;
and, luckily, you know, she can't speak plain, to
put bad words in their mouths. Poor Sally! I
could not let her remain at Lea, in that state;
and I think she is very comfortable here with
the children and Bobby."</p>

<p>"Where are the children? Where is Tom,
and where is Moll and Bab?" asked Tom Pynsent.
"Bell must see the children&mdash;Bell will
want to see the children&mdash;I thought I heard
them screaming just now, somewhere."</p>

<p>"They were fighting over a brush just now in
the second hall," replied his mother, "and they
nearly killed the baby. I expected the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
little thing would have got a broken head in the
scuffle, but he fought like a fury, and sent his
fist into Moll's eye."</p>

<p>"They do fight dreadfully," observed Anna
Maria.</p>

<p>"Let them alone, I won't have them checked,"
cried their grandmother; "when they have had
thumps enough, they will be quiet. Moll is
worse than the baby; but their spirits are so
high, I won't have them cowed."</p>

<p>"Bell," said Tom Pynsent, with a tone and look
of honest pride, "you have pretty scamps for
your relations. Tom rides a Shetland after the
hounds, and Moll runs up a tree like a young
squirrel. Bab and the baby are improving, too,
by their example. Tally ho! I hear them!"
he ran to the door, and opened it. "Tally ho,
there! Tom and Moll, bring the litter this
way!"</p>

<p>The four children burst into the drawing-room
like a pack of hounds, and the baby, a
stout child of a year old toddling in, he fell
down, and the others ran over him. Tom Pynsent
caught up the sturdy boy.</p>

<p>"Don't give tongue, you young rascal, but
fight 'em, Bill&mdash;here, double your fists at them
all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The child mechanically closed his little fists,
and his father placed him before Miss Bab.</p>

<p>"Battle her well, Bill, rattle her."</p>

<p>The child, who had not yet cast his cap, dealt
a blow at his sister, which Miss Bab returned
by knocking him down. The child did not attempt
to cry at the blow, but, rising from the
floor, he again doubled his infantine fists for the
battle. Tom Pynsent was delighted.</p>

<p>"Well done, Bill, well done, my sharp lad!
Come, that's enough at a time! Live to fight
another day, Bill!"</p>

<p>"Come to your granny, my sharpshooter,"
cried Mrs. Pynsent; "I have something in my
pocket for stout-hearted men!"</p>

<p>Billy toddled to his grandmother, who drew
a box of sugarplums from her capacious pocket,
and rewarded his prowess by a shower of sweets.
Tom and Moll were likewise engaged in a controversy,
which threatened to end in an engagement.
They were quarrelling over Christobelle's
parasol, Moll demanding it to walk with, and
be a lady, like aunt Bell, while Tom insisted upon
shouldering it like a bayonet, as the Count de
Nolis had taught him. The dispute ran very
high.</p>

<p>"Tom, dear, don't let the children fight,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
said Anna Maria, as she examined the make and
material of her sister's silk pelisse, "they have
been fighting all day."</p>

<p>"Aunt Bell, mayn't I have it?" screamed
little Moll, as she struggled with her brother for
the possession of the parasol.</p>

<p>"I will have it first!" roared Tom, dragging
the handle from her grasp.</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen extricated the parasol from
their hands, and kept possession of it during
their stay in the drawing-room, but no one else
attempted to release Christobelle's property from
the struggle. Tom Pynsent called their attention
from their defeat.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, catch papa if you can, and show
your aunt whether your legs are as stout as your
lungs. Moll! Bab! Bill! now for it!"</p>

<p>The drawing-room became a scene of dreadful
confusion. Tom Pynsent, delighted to show off
his children, and always the foremost to give
them pleasure, threaded the mazes of the tables
and chairs, while the little ones raced screaming
and hallooing after him. Mr. Boscawen sought
a retreat from their deafening shouts by quitting
the room, and even Anna Maria half closed her
eyes, as she assured her sister they made really
more noise that day than ever, in compliment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
she supposed, to her arrival. Mrs. Pynsent sat
with the box of sugarplums on her lap, enjoying
the din of voices, and inciting them forward, by
clapping her hands and exclaiming:&mdash;"Hurrah,
my lads and lasses, catch him! Round the
chair, Bill!&mdash;down you go&mdash;up again&mdash;well
done, my hearty! Halloo there, Moll! Bab,
you be hanged!" Mr. Pynsent looked overpowered,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>Such were the sports of Hatton. The commotion
continued till both parties, the chaser
and the chased, became wearied with their exertions,
and then the children wished to go and
ride their rocking-horses. Mrs. Pynsent loaded
them with sweetmeats and good advice, as she
dismissed each from her presence.</p>

<p>"I say, you young Tommy, don't suck your
fingers, but look to that poor morsel of a Bill, and
don't run over him. If he falls, pick him up, and
wipe his nose, like a little gentleman. Here, my
Moll in the wad, look at your torn frock,
and don't thump Bab upon the back so hard.
Never mind, Bab, here's six sugarplums for that
thump, and you must give it Moll well, to-morrow.
What, Bill, old boy! you must have
sugarplums, too, must you? There then, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
toddle after them, my sharpshooter. Go all
of you to old aunt Hancock."</p>

<p>When the children were gone, Christobelle
had time to give her attention to Anna Maria.
The elegance of Miss Wetheral had in a great
degree lost its tone, but Mrs. Tom Pynsent was
fashionably French still in her dress and appearance.
Rouging very highly gave an unnatural
brilliance to her eyes, and her figure had become
enlarged, though not in the same proportion
with Isabel: Christobelle thought her handsome
and striking, but she was not the pale, still, and
interestingly elegant woman, who had volunteered
her affections to the stout, good-looking,
red-faced Tom Pynsent. Many might have
considered Anna Maria improved by the change
which had gradually taken place in her appearance;
but Christobelle had admired her so
greatly in her more youthful days, that her eye
could not reconcile itself to her present style.
There was, she thought, something too garish in
the deeply-rouged cheek and glittering eye of
her sister.</p>

<p>Her affection for her husband was quite unchanged:
she still spoke of him with powerful
affection, and dilated upon his unvaried kindness
and good temper with vivacity. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Christobelle's long absence, Tom had never
changed towards her in indulgence and interest.
Mrs. Pynsent was all that could be desired in a
mother-in-law, for her warm heart never fancied
she could do enough for those she loved; and
poor Mr. Pynsent was in nobody's way. Anna
Maria doted upon her children, and she confessed
herself to be "the happiest woman in the
world, when the children did not fight, but
they certainly did fight furiously, and Tom and
his mother encouraged it."</p>

<p>Christobelle asked after the health of Flic.</p>

<p>"Oh, Flic is very well, but she cannot comprehend
a word of English, stupid girl, and I am
losing my French. Every body borrows Flic,
and she travels all round the county before any
public meeting takes place. Flic is always
borrowed by Pen Spottiswoode before the races,
and, when she appears, you would declare her
clothes were cut out by the Lidham cook, instead
of Flic. Pen never dressed well, you
know, Bell."</p>

<p>"Miss Bell," cried Mrs. Pynsent, from a distant
corner of the drawing-room, "have you
heard any tidings from Bedinfield? because there
is a rod in pickle for somebody in that quarter.
Your poor sister has made a sorry concern of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
that grand match, which was to her so desirable.
Not much better a business than Lady Kerrison's!
Report is saying the deuce and all of
poor Miss Julia and that colonel. That dowager
never was liked by any one, for her acquaintance
was always a blight upon the poor soul who
made it."</p>

<p>Christobelle asked if her sister had been in
Shropshire, since their removal into Scotland.</p>

<p>"No, my dear; Lady Ennismore has never
suffered her son to bring your sister into Shropshire,
since her return to England. She has her
own reasons for it. I know what I could call
her, only I have promised Sally Hancock never
to use large words, now her own mouth is
stopped, poor thing! If your sister elopes with
that moustache fellow, it will be the fault of
those who married her to such a poor creature
as my lord."</p>

<p>"Have you heard any thing in <i>particular</i>
about Julia, my dear Anna Maria?" asked
Christobelle, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Reports only," was her reply, "but they
begin to assume a form. There are very strange
reports about Colonel Neville, but we do not
hear from Julia; she has never written to me
since I went to the altar with her, and I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
tired with writing unanswered letters. Papa
told us when he returned with you from Bedinfield,
that it was vain to hope she would ever be
withdrawn from the dowager; and if she did
discover treachery, it would only make her
wretched, without a hope of escape. Lord Ennismore
is devoted to his mother, and Julia would
suffer, he thought, by any complaints on her side.
We hear Lord Ennismore is in a poor way, but
we know nothing: Julia might as well be in
another hemisphere, since we neither meet nor
correspond. How miserably Clara and Julia
have been in their choice, Bell! I cannot be too
thankful I won my dear Tom at last."</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Bell," cried Mrs. Pynsent from
her corner, where she sat knitting, "I say, Miss
Bell, when does Sir Jacky return to us?" Anna
Maria smiled at her sister's confusion. Christobelle
hesitated for a moment to reply.</p>

<p>"Miss Bell, Sir Jacky is a great favourite of
mine, and I want to hear a little about him.
Come here, Miss Bell, come nearer to me, I
want to ask a question."</p>

<p>Christobelle approached Mrs. Pynsent, amused
at the idea of her intended jokes, which could
not offend, since only Anna Maria was now present.
The two gentlemen had sought for Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Boscawen when the children dispersed. She,
therefore, seated herself near her.</p>

<p>"What have you to say to me, Mrs. Pynsent,
that is not kind and pleasant at all times?"</p>

<p>"I have this to say," she replied, with a seriousness
foreign to her usual manner, "I have to
say, that, much as I liked you as a girl, I love
you far better than ever, <i>now</i>, because you had
the sense to refuse a young coroneted rascal
some time ago, and choose a man who will be a
jewel to you. You showed sense and spirit in
refusing to be man&#339;uvred into wickedness, to
lead the abominable life which two of your sisters
have been doomed to suffer; and you showed
a right woman's warm heart, in taking a man
whom I like and respect next to my own Tom
for comeliness and godliness. When a young
woman marries such a tight lad as Jacky Spottiswoode,
she knows she will be happy to the
day of her death, and be respected among her
friends. Now, Miss Bell, what do you say to
that?"</p>

<p>Christobelle said nothing. Tears filled her
eyes, and spoke volumes for her. She was
affected with the idea that all her friends, except
<i>one</i>, approved the connexion she was about to
form. Mrs. Pynsent's remarks affected her still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
more, because they were spoken with unusual
quietness of manner and phrase, and her words
ever came from the fountain of her heart in all
truth and sincerity. She spoke, too, the sentiments
of those around her; Christobelle judged
so, by Mrs. Pynsent assuring her of the respect
of her friends. It was a deep gratification to
think her attachment was sanctioned by those
she loved and honoured; and it was a grateful
pride to feel assured the finger of scorn or ridicule
had never pointed observations offensive to
the high character of her beloved Spottiswoode.
Was it to be wondered at that she sat silent by
the side of Mrs. Pynsent, enjoying feelings too
blessed for utterance? She saw her agitation,
and forbore to notice it; but Mrs. Pynsent was
not wanting in real delicacy to those who did
not offend her notions of right; and to Christobelle
she had ever shown peculiar kindness. She
addressed her daughter.</p>

<p>"I say, Anna Maria, we'll have old Sally Hancock
to spend the evening with us, to compliment
Miss Bell. It's all over with Sal now, so
she won't shock the company. You need not be
afraid of Sally Hancock any more, for she can't
speak, if she was dying for it. I can see her
poor eyes glare up sometimes; you won't mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Sally Hancock. She likes to watch the children,
and when they don't pull her crutch from
her, they are great friends. Moll and Bab often
imitate her walk, but Sally Hancock only laughs
at them."</p>

<p>"I wish the children would not fight so much,"
remarked Anna Maria.</p>

<p>"Fiddle diddle! my Tom fought Pen Spottiswoode
like a dragon when he was their age,
and he is all the better for it. I don't like to
keep down their spirits. How would our little
Moll climb the sycamore, if she hadn't a fearless
spirit? Well, look at Bobby, between those
two great monsters upon the lawn! Boscawen
looks such a long animal, compared with Bobby.
Don't you think Bobby is worn into half a goose,
Miss Bell? He looks trussed for the spit."</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Pynsent looking very well&mdash;better
than your letters insinuated, Mrs. Pynsent."</p>

<p>"Poor Bobby! no, he's nothing better than
half a goose now; but Sally Hancock and myself
remember him a smart lad. There goes the
half-hour bell!"</p>

<p>"Come, then, Bell, we will depart, for my
toilette is a long affair," said her sister, rising.</p>

<p>"I say," called Mrs. Pynsent, as they left the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
room, "I say, Anna Maria, don't let Bell into
the secrets of the prison-house."</p>

<p>"Oh! Bell knows all about <i>that</i>!" replied
the laughing Anna Maria. "Tom is the only
person who does not know my secret. Every
body knows I only rouge to please Tom."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>


<p>Hatton was by no means so agreeable a <i>sjour</i>
to Christobelle as in former days. The Pynsents
were never happy without the four unruly
children constantly in their sight; and their
amusements were the chief subjects under consideration.
The children scrambled over the
table to snatch at the dessert; they were admitted
in the drawing-room at all hours, and in
every phase of dirt and fighting; they were to
drag heavy weights round the room at pleasure,
and every one made themselves a party in their
quarrels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pynsent generally advocated the part of
the baby, whom she designated "that proper
divil of a Bill," with a hearty vehemence which
increased the uproar and confusion; while her
son, with stentorian voice, argued in favour of
the girls. Anna Maria rarely interfered in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
alarum which occurred. She sat smiling at the
fray, only her distress was occasionally awakened
by the length and frequency of the battles, and
her taste was offended at intervals, by the disagreeable
abbreviation of their names. She
"wished her Mary could be called by her right
name, and not Moll. She would give any thing
they would call the baby Willy, instead of that
horrid 'Bill;' and as to Bab, it was a shocking
word; but Bab she would be called for ever.
Barbara was too long a word for her mother and
Tom to pronounce. Sometimes she fancied their
noise must be disagreeable to their guests, but
Tom loved to have the little things round him."</p>

<p>The Pynsents were, therefore, the happiest
people possible in themselves; but it was extremely
disagreeable. Every body must think
Hatton a very disagreeable place to stay at now;
and Christobelle was glad to escape with Mr.
Boscawen the following day to Lidham. She had
little difficulty in privately persuading him to curtail
their intended stay at Hatton, and proceed to
the Spottiswoodes. He, as well as Christobelle,
felt the utter hopelessness of procuring a peaceful
moment, where every thought and feeling
was absorbed in four remarkably noisy children.
How very different to the Hatton of other days,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
when she enjoyed the society of her sister undisturbed,
and spent there such happy hours of
her life! It was there, too, she met first the
man whom she hoped to make happy for long
years of futurity.</p>

<p>Christobelle thought they should never be
allowed to enter the carriage when it drew up
to the door. The children were delighted to
get in and out, and Tom particularly amused
himself with putting up the steps and throwing
them down again with as much noise as the
leather would allow. Tom Pynsent detained
Christobelle in the hall, to enable her to enjoy a
scene which he considered most delectable; and
Mrs. Pynsent uttered exclamations of delight,
as she watched the baby trying with all its might
to imitate his companions.</p>

<p>"I say, Tom, do look at that divil of a Bill,
trying to clamber into the carriage; did you
ever see such a young dog? Moll, put Bill into
the carriage. Let my sharpshooter take his
turn. Moll, you'll break his leg!"</p>

<p>The "sharpshooter" was handed into the carriage
by the butler, for "Moll" could not lift the
scrambling child, and they all began jumping
upon the seat till a battle commenced, through
the instrumentality of Bab, who had pulled Tom's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
hair rather too roughly. The screams of Tom
were echoed by the baby; and Bab cried violently
at her own ferocity. Tom Pynsent and
their grandmother both spoke at once, in their
loudest key.</p>

<p>"Halloo there, you young ones. Bill, what
are you at, all of you? Hand out that young
dog," cried Mrs. Pynsent.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you all roaring at? Moll,
what's the matter?" called out Tom Pynsent.</p>

<p>"Pa, Bab pulled Tom's hair!" screamed Miss
Mary, alias Moll; Mrs. Pynsent's words now
became confounded with those of her son.</p>

<p>"What the devil!&mdash;don't fight there, you
rascals!&mdash;Hand out Bill, James; they'll kill that
poor Bill.&mdash;Here, Tom, never mind your hair:
bring some cakes here, Dick, to stop this row.&mdash;Hand
out that Bill thing, Thomas, he's on his
head.&mdash;They're murdering Bill!"</p>

<p>"I declare my children will fight themselves
to death," said Anna Maria, who took no part
in the affair, "I am sure they will kill each
other. Tom, dear, don't let the children fight
so."</p>

<p>Mr. Boscawen took advantage of the moment
when the carriage was emptied of its noisy contents,
and hurried Christobelle into it. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was too willing to quit the uproar of Hatton
not to rejoice at his polite movement, and both
were glad to remain silent for some time after
they had quitted its grounds.</p>

<p>"I fancied," said Mr. Boscawen, after a long
pause, "that Isabel spoiled her children, till I
have now compared them with their cousins. I
shall remain satisfied in future that they are not
more vivacious than healthy children should be."</p>

<p>"It is altogether a different form of government
at Brierly. You are monarch, though an
indulgent one; but it is a frightful democracy
at Hatton."</p>

<p>"I shall keep my young ones out of the infection,"
he observed; "for though Mary and
Barbara may have hearts as kindly affectioned
as their grandmother, those manners are deplorable.
I should be sorry to see my little
Bell become coarse and loud in her way of speaking."</p>

<p>"What could be the cause of the Miss Wycherlys
imbibing such manners, in the first instance?"
asked Christobelle.</p>

<p>"Old Wycherly was a broker," replied Boscawen;
"and he retired to Lidham with an immense
fortune, and a young wife whose connections
were far superior to his own. Mrs. Wycherly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
did not live many years, and the daughters
were allowed to educate themselves, and to
act, in every respect, as seemed good in their
own eyes. They were always the subject of conversation;
and, though they never were suspected
of any thing more reprehensible than extreme
wildness, their conduct subjected them to
many extraordinary scenes, and much objectionable
remark. Captain Hancock drank, I believe,
to drown care, and Mrs. Hancock was infinitely
the worst of the two. How the young ladies
learned their swearing propensities, I cannot
tell; but I have heard that their brother Wycherly
led them into very exceptionable society
in his youthful days. They were an extraordinary
trio. No one, however, spoke ill of them."</p>

<p>"They had great good nature, I suppose."</p>

<p>"They had great wealth, Bell, or they never
could have held any position in society. Four
hundred thousand pounds drew the first gentlemen
in the county to Lidham."</p>

<p>Christobelle chatted till the Lidham woods
rose in sight, and then she became silent. Every
thing connected with the name of Spottiswoode
held a powerful interest in her heart, and concentrated
her thoughts upon himself. She had
heard from him once since her arrival at Brierly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and then he spoke so cheerlessly of her mother's
spirits, that he lingered to assist and console her
father. He knew, he said, that he was giving
her pleasure by attending upon her father, and
he hoped so much from his assiduities! Dear
Spottiswoode, how much more sanguinely than
herself did he expect a change in her mother's
sentiments!</p>

<p>As the carriage drove through the lodges, a
gentleman on horseback galloped towards them.
"Here comes Charles full of news," said Boscawen;
"and he is riding fast, I suppose, to
carry it fresh into Shrewsbury. A little news
is a passport among one's neighbours."</p>

<p>Christobelle bent forward to observe Charles
Spottiswoode; but no, it was <i>not</i> Charles Spottiswoode.
Her heart beat thickly, and her eyes
strained to gaze. She knew the horseman from
afar: she knew the air, the figure, and the style
of riding, well. Was her lover winging his way
to her?&mdash;was he thinking of Brierly, and one
there who loved him better than herself? Christobelle
caught her brother's hand. "Boscawen,
it is not him, it is <i>John</i> Spottiswoode! what
brings him so soon from Fairlee?"</p>

<p>"God bless me!" cried Boscawen, "it is indeed
our friend from the north, and I must stop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
him, or he will never condescend to look at us."
He put his head out of the carriage-window, and
waved his hand: Sir John Spottiswoode heeded
not the movement. He was riding rapidly by,
and would have passed with a slight inclination
of the head, had not Christobelle caught his eye.
His handsome face glowed with surprise and
delight, while her own feelings, so very suddenly
called into action, completely took away her
powers of speech. She could only hold out her
hand, as he checked his horse, and wheeled round
to the window, but it was pressed <i>so</i> fondly&mdash;and
he looked <i>so</i> bright and happy!</p>

<p>"Why, Spottiswoode, what fair lady are you
scampering after, that you nearly passed by <i>us</i>?"
exclaimed Boscawen, shaking him by the hand.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I am going to turn back with
you. Indeed, I was galloping to Shrewsbury, to
get upon the coach for Brierly. I only arrived
this morning."</p>

<p>"My <i>mother</i>, Spottiswoode," uttered Christobelle,
in alarm&mdash;"how is my mother?"</p>

<p>"On her road to Wetheral, by short stages;
I am but their <i>avant courier</i>, Chrystal. I have
brought a letter for you. You will now, perhaps,
offer me a seat in your carriage to Brierly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
when you return. My brother said nothing
about your visit&mdash;do they expect you?"</p>

<p>"No, I am making a tour with my young
sister&mdash;but let us reach Lidham before we enter
into particulars."</p>

<p>The carriage moved on, and Spottiswoode
rode by its side. How unexpected was this
meeting, and how busy were Christobelle's
thoughts, conjecturing upon the motive of her
mother's early journey! If it had but a happy
reference towards herself, how would her cup of
joy be filled! but, no, her mother never forgave
an offence like hers!</p>

<p>Christobelle was prepared to meet astonishment
at Lidham, as she had found it every where
else, since her return into Shropshire, and she
was not deceived. Mrs. Charles Spottiswoode
held her from her at arm's length, as she examined
her person and growth.</p>

<p>"My dear little Bell, is this really and truly
yourself? I have heard of you from persons
whom I did not consider altogether unprejudiced
in their accounts; but, indeed, I now see it with
my own eyes! John, you have not said half
enough of this creature. I recognise her eyes&mdash;those
large eyes&mdash;but these ringlets&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
figure&mdash;no, John, upon my honour, you did not
do her justice!"</p>

<p>Spottiswoode stood by Christobelle, and his
eyes flashed a proud satisfaction at the remarks
of his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"But, Charles, Charles," she continued, "tell
me if <i>you</i> could recognise Bell Wetheral in this
grand creature! tell me if it is not a vision, for
I cannot think I really see the prim little Bell,
always poring over books, and diving out of her
father's study with a little shock head, like my
terrier Tarter!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I recognise Miss Wetheral," answered
Mr. Spottiswoode, "for I see the same expression
of good-humour, and the same fine outline, which
gave such promise of what we behold. Miss
Wetheral, you are most welcome to Lidham."</p>

<p>"By the Lord Harry!" cried Mr. Wycherly,
emerging from his own room in spectacles, "here's
a <i>posse comitatus</i>! Well, I'm come to welcome
the new filly myself. How d'ye do, Miss Wetheral?&mdash;how
d'ye do, ma'am? God help us,
how the young people grow! They run us down,
Mr. Boscawen! You are come to stay a week&mdash;a
month with us, I hope? Come in, come in,
all of you!" They entered the sitting-room, and
the conversation was general for a short time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
till Mrs. Spottiswoode suddenly turned to Christobelle.</p>

<p>"My dear Bell, I know what your anxiety
must be, to hear of those whom John has left
behind. I see, by the expression of those large
eyes, that you are longing to hear news of Fairlee.
Come with me, and I give John alone leave to
follow us. We will adjourn into the library. I
can quite understand your feelings. John, you
may follow us with your letters."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode led Christobelle into the
library, and there she again embraced her. The
first reception, she said, belonged to Miss Wetheral,
but now she embraced her future relation&mdash;the
bride of her excellent John&mdash;the brother
beloved by all! She was embracing now the
future Lady Spottiswoode. Christobelle returned
her embrace with fervent pleasure. She said
her heart rejoiced in the congratulations of her
friends, and in the language of praise which
always accompanied the mention of Spottiswoode's
name. She only hoped&mdash;and she expressed
the hope with tears&mdash;that her mother
would in time see Spottiswoode with the eyes of
all who knew his great worth; that she would in
time receive him as a dear son, and remove the
only impediment to her happiness, by extending
the hand of friendship towards him, and her pardon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
towards herself. Mrs. Spottiswoode hoped
all things.</p>

<p>"My dear Chrystal&mdash;which, by the by, is a
prettier designation than Bell&mdash;there is bitter in
every cup. Rest happy in the knowledge that
Lady Wetheral's offended feelings proceed from
disappointed views, and not from unworthiness
in the object. It must always be painful to displease
a parent, but it cannot, in this particular
case, strike deep into your happiness. Your
excellent father long wished for the match&mdash;he
confessed it to John. Come in!" A gentle tap
at the door was heard, and Spottiswoode entered.</p>

<p>"You allowed me to follow you&mdash;am I welcome
now?"</p>

<p>"Ever welcome, wherever you appear, John;
and most welcome to Chrystal and myself," said
Mrs. Spottiswoode; "I will leave you while you
read your letters together. I shall allow you a
quarter of an hour, to acquaint yourself with
their contents, Chrystal."</p>

<p>"One hour, Pen&mdash;only one little sixty-five
minutes!" cried Spottiswoode, beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you shall not monopolize my guest
an hour, John. Do as you please at Brierly&mdash;but
I will only relinquish Chrystal a quarter of
an hour from this moment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Chrystal!" said Spottiswoode, as the door
closed upon his sister&mdash;"Chrystal!"</p>

<p>Christobelle beheld her lover's arms extended.
Away with every feeling but unfeigned joy to
behold him again. She flew towards him, to be
clasped to his dear, warm heart! "And now,"
she said, when their spirits had become somewhat
tranquil, "tell me of my father, and tell me of
my mother. Are they on the road?"</p>

<p>She listened with trembling eagerness to his
reply. Spottiswoode had not seen Lady Wetheral
since Christobelle quitted Fairlee. She
could not be persuaded to leave her room, or
resume the direction of the establishment. Sir
John Wetheral suffered greatly from her determined
resolution to avoid the man on whom he
had bestowed his daughter; and he felt deeply,
also, the privation of domestic comfort. It was
that privation which kept Spottiswoode at Fairlee&mdash;he
was anxious to be useful to the father who
mourned her daughter's absence, and felt alone,
in his own house.</p>

<p>Spottiswoode knew Christobelle would wish
him to stay and solace her father&mdash;and he did
stay; but his thoughts were chained to Brierly,
while he lingered at Lochleven. He had never
trusted himself to visit places where they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
roamed together. He had not once dared to
seat himself on the rocky bench, or walk the
terrace by moonlight. He had sat constantly
reading in the window which witnessed their first
confession of attachment, and he numbered the
days which lagged heavily between him and his
rest. He had been three weeks absent from all
he loved.</p>

<p>How Christobelle dwelt upon the words which
fell from Spottiswoode's lips! She could not
sorrow for her mother's harshness while he was
near her. She only felt the calm of his presence,
and the absence of every regret. But she
should weep when she was alone again! She
should suffer when she had time to reflect upon
every thing&mdash;but not at <i>that</i> moment, for the
arm of Spottiswoode encircled her, and she was
too happy to reflect.</p>

<p>Christobelle received no letter from Lady
Wetheral, but her father wrote to her of all he
suffered; and he said, his happiest moments were
passed in contemplating her prospects. His
Chrystal was given to a man who would value
the blessing conferred upon him. She would be
the wife of a good man&mdash;a wife as happy as Isabel,
or as Anna Maria proved to be&mdash;a wife
whose hopes were anchored upon high principle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and religious feeling, and who, therefore, would
not be called upon to endure the undying torments
of self-reproach.</p>

<p>He could not allow himself to think upon
Clara&mdash;but she had been removed early from her
strife. What Julia's destiny would be, he could
not venture to assert. She was a banished child
to him. They were to begin their journey the
day after Spottiswoode quitted Fairlee, but the
passage would be very slowly made, as her mother
could not endure travelling long&mdash;her nerves
were worse than ever. Her father urged her to
be at Wetheral to receive them. If her other
parent would not see her, Wetheral was large
enough to contain them apart, but <i>he</i> could not
live without her, and she must not disappoint
him of her presence. Her father concluded his
epistle with a thousand parental blessings and
cares for her future comforts.</p>

<p>Spottiswoode watched Christobelle as she read.
"Is it a letter of comfort, my Chrystal?" he
asked, as she finished its perusal. "Yes, I think
so, by those large eyes, as Pen calls them. It
<i>is</i> a letter of comfort, is it not, dearest Chrystal?"</p>

<p>Christobelle placed it silently into his hands,
and she now watched Spottiswoode as he read.
She saw the deepened red upon his cheek, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
lingered over her father's commendation, and his
eye met her own.</p>

<p>"Every word of it is true, Spottiswoode," she
observed.</p>

<p>"You are a partial, dear creature, Chrystal;
but I will try to deserve his opinion so kindly
expressed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode entered. "Three minutes
past the quarter, John, and every one is impatient
to see Chrystal again. Papa says she is as beautiful
as his celebrated colt, which is the height
of his commendation. I am jealous, too, myself
of your society. You must return with me, good
people." She led them forth.</p>

<p>Christobelle conferred with Boscawen upon
the contents of her father's letter. Since he
wished her to be at Wetheral when he arrived,
she thought she had better not return to Brierly.
They might travel more rapidly than was anticipated.
Lady Wetheral might feel more equal
to the journey than she imagined, and Christobelle
might be at Brierly the moment they
reached Wetheral. She felt she would prefer
returning to Wetheral from Lidham; and Isabel
would understand the circumstances, which left
her no power to act otherwise. She would
return to Brierly at a future time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do as you please, my dear Chrystal: I think
you are right in your decision. Your trunks
shall be forwarded to Wetheral, and I will see
you safely there to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, nonsense!" said Mrs. Spottiswoode.
"Mr. Boscawen, you are an excellent
guardian, but I cannot think your scheme a good
one. Leave Chrystal with us: we are only three
miles from Wetheral, and I will drive her over
every day, to make preparations. If Sir John
Wetheral should arrive unexpectedly, she will be
there in twenty minutes&mdash;Chrystal shall not
remain alone in that enormous place!"</p>

<p>Much consultation took place, and it was decided,
at last, that Christobelle should accept
Mrs. Spottiswoode's invitation, and remain at
Lidham: Mr. Boscawen consequently changed
his own plans, and determined to return immediately
to Brierly. The horses were yet at
Lidham, and they should take him back to
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>"Now what extreme folly, my dear Mr. Boscawen!
You intended to stay here with Chrystal:
why not allow us still the pleasure of your
company?" Mrs. Spottiswoode would not hear
of his departure. "Charles, persuade Mr. Boscawen
to remain at Lidham!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Boscawen was resolved to return to
Isabel: "he was in attendance upon Christobelle
when he left his home; and now that
charge was removed, he must return to Brierly
and Isabel. He should acquaint her with
Christobelle's movements, and he felt obliged
by their wish to detain him, but he never left
Isabel unless a momentous care devolved upon
him, such as watching over the personal safety
of his attractive sister Bell, or a child's tooth to
be extracted. He should return <i>now</i> in time
for Isabel's tea."</p>

<p>Excellent Boscawen! How fortunate was
Isabel in securing a man so devoted to her comforts,
and so loth to be absent from her. Her
father was indeed right when he said Boscawen's
age was the only objection he could urge against
him.</p>

<p>And Christobelle was left at Lidham with the
Spottiswoodes&mdash;the Miss Wycherly of other
days, when Julia was her bosom-friend, and the
Charles Spottiswoode with whom she suffered
so long and despairingly, till Julia's bold confession
ended the painful suspense on both sides!
She was also wedded in heart to the elder
brother, and their renewed acquaintance sprung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
at once into friendship at the very moment of
its renewal.</p>

<p>But where was Julia, who used to gladden
her friends' heart so often? Where was the
confidante of Penelope Wycherly, who used to
fly to Lidham, to console and assist her friend in
adversity, caused by her own transgressions?
Where was that sprightly, affectionate creature?
Alas! she was lost to her friends, and her voice
had ceased to be heard among them! More
than five years had elapsed since Julia's marriage,
and from that hour she had never seen
Lidham, or its inmates; she had not even noticed
the nuptials of its mistress. What a change
must have come over Julia!</p>

<p>It was a day of exquisite enjoyment at Lidham.
Mrs. Spottiswoode loved to look at
Christobelle, for she said she was strangely like
Julia, and her heart bounded towards her as to
an old and dear friend. Spottiswoode was also
at her side, and there were no noisy children to
break the tranquillity of her enjoyment by their
unwelcome mirth. How could she be otherwise
than most happy? What evil could reach her,
while those she loved were near, and she could
listen to the voice of her beloved one? None!</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode engaged the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
morning to drive Christobelle to Wetheral, and
the ladies agreed to remain quietly in the house
with their work, till the hour arrived for their
airing. It was then that Mrs. Spottiswoode
opened her heart, and told Christobelle all her
fears respecting Julia's happiness. She heard
only reports like the rest of the world; but they
were reports which filled her with uneasiness
and apprehension. She felt assured her friend
had been sacrificed, and she was equally certain
the Dowager-countess had been the mental vampire
which clung to Julia, and destroyed her
peace, by interfering with and withholding her
correspondence. Sir John Wetheral had suspected
as much at Bedinfield himself&mdash;she knew
it was not Julia's nature to forget her friends&mdash;she
would never credit the assertion, let who
would insinuate it.</p>

<p>Reports breathed suspicion on her fame, with
regard to Colonel Neville; but she would stake
her existence that, however Julia's taste must
have turned disgusted from her wretched lord,
she was pure as unsunned snow. Any one who
dared to question her friend's purity of mind
before her, would rouse the blood of all the
Wycherlys in her veins. Charles did not like
the subject ever brought forward in her presence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
because she felt keenly every remark which
touched upon her friend's miserable fate; but
now the gentlemen were out of the way, she
could unfold her fears to Christobelle.</p>

<p>"If ever there was a wretch in the form of
mortal, Chrystal," she continued, "it is that
wicked dowager; and we shall live to see it
confirmed in the case of my poor Julia, the friend
of my youth, whom I loved so dearly. I told
Charles she was going to woe, when she was led
like a lamb to the slaughter! Oh, Julia should
<i>not</i> have married Lord Ennismore, Chrystal!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode became affected as she
dwelt upon the scenes of the past; and she detailed
to Christobelle many incidents which had
escaped her young observation. It was delightful
to Christobelle to hear her talk of Julia,
and her eyes often bore testimony to the sympathy
she felt in the narration of their long
friendship, and the events of their earliest days.
The hall-door bell pealed its sounds as they wept
and talked. Mrs. Spottiswoode was surprised
and annoyed; she breathed hastily upon her
hands, and applied them to her eyes.</p>

<p>"How very disagreeably early some people are
calling; and our eyes, Chrystal, are quite unfit
to be seen! I must draw down the blinds. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
really cannot receive any one with such a pair
of eyes and such a heavy heart, comfortably."</p>

<p>The door was thrown open, but no name was
announced. A female figure, however, appeared,
and approached slowly and unsteadily
towards Mrs. Spottiswoode. She spoke in
tones which startled her ear and heart.</p>

<p>"I am come to try my friend's truth; for she
told me that in evil report, or in good report,
in weal or woe, <i>here</i> I should find rest!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode stood motionless.</p>

<p>"Julia!" she faintly uttered&mdash;"is this Julia's
voice!"</p>

<p>"It is Julia, Penelope! I am come to seek
my promised home, for elsewhere there is none!"</p>

<p>"Welcome, a thousand welcomes!" cried
Mrs. Spottiswoode, springing towards Lady Ennismore,
and clasping her to her heart with a
straining pressure&mdash;"oh! welcome, whatever
event may have brought my lost Julia home!"</p>

<p>"Home!" replied Lady Ennismore&mdash;"home!
Have I been obliged to return from whence I
came, to find a home!" Lady Ennismore shuddered
as she spoke, and fell senseless in the
still close embrace of her friend.</p>

<p>"Chrystal!" cried Mrs. Spottiswoode, "bolt
the door: let no one enter this room!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Wetheral obeyed in silence, and she
then assisted Mrs. Spottiswoode in conveying
her sister to the sofa, where she remained extended
till her consciousness gradually returned.
Mrs. Spottiswoode trembled, but her powers of
thought were clear and undisturbed. She spoke
low, as Lady Ennismore lay in blessed forgetfulness
of present sufferings.</p>

<p>"Chrystal, we will carry Julia into your
room when she recovers, and here my angel
friend will be tranquil. I will trust&mdash;I <i>know</i>
she is blameless! but a thousand errors would
not change my love, or the devotion with which
I will watch over her for ever. If all the world
deserted her, she would be <i>my</i> own dear friend;
but for her fame's sake, I hope&mdash;no, it is <i>not</i> so&mdash;it
is <i>not</i> so!"</p>

<p>Christobelle gazed in astonishment at her
sister's extended form. She mechanically
obeyed Mrs. Spottiswoode's directions, but her
mind was a chaos. She heard her remarks,
though she did not reply to them; she could
not withdraw her eyes from the object which
absorbed all her wonder.</p>

<p>"Chrystal," continued Mrs. Spottiswoode, as
she chafed Julia's temples with eau de Cologne,
"there has been dreadful work to bring my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
blessed friend to this! Her spirit has been
dealt with beyond her powers of endurance, to
urge this step; but I, Penelope, am with her,
and she is again at Lidham. I bless the events
which have brought her from banishment, and
given her again to her friends!"</p>

<p>A slight pressure from the hand which was
clasped by Mrs. Spottiswoode, attested returning
animation in Lady Ennismore, and proved
that she heard and understood her friends'
words. Mrs. Spottiswoode proceeded with deep
feeling.</p>

<p>"Julia, you hear me&mdash;you hear your friend
declare, that she cannot mourn the cause which
has given her back the companion of her early
days. We were ever together, Julia, and together
we enjoyed our first step upon the gay
stage of our pleasures. We will also walk together
through the waters of adversity, and our
sorrows shall be, as our joys have been, borne
in fellowship. I am Penelope Wycherly in
<i>heart</i>, and you are Julia Wetheral. We will
part no more, my own dear, ill-used friend!"</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore raised her head from its
pillow with effort.</p>

<p>"I have been hardly dealt with, I have been
cruelly treated, Penelope! I must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
very treacherously used, since I believed in the
desertion of all my friends!"</p>

<p>"I see it all; I have long seen and feared all
this, Julia! I know the snares which have been
set to wreck your happiness, and throw you
from your husband's heart! I know the influence
which was feared and counteracted by that
vile woman, with all the energy of vileness!"</p>

<p>A fit of trembling attacked Lady Ennismore,
and cold perspiration bedewed her face and
hands.</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> have seen it, or can understand it,
Penelope," she exclaimed, "how must <i>I</i> have
felt it!" Lady Ennismore sunk back with the
effort of speaking.</p>

<p>"Chrystal," said Mrs. Spottiswoode, "let us
support Lady Ennismore to your room at once.
There alone will be security and quiet. The
gentlemen may be returning."</p>

<p>"What gentlemen?" exclaimed Lady Ennismore,
hastily. "Don't allow Neville to come
near me. I will never see him again."</p>

<p>"No one is coming, my own Julia, but
Charles Spottiswoode. You remember Charles
Spottiswoode&mdash;your friend and mine, and now
my husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him, but I never heard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
your nuptials; every body was so silent, every
thing was kept from me!"</p>

<p>"Did Colonel Neville never inform you of
Shropshire events, through the medium of the
papers, dearest?"</p>

<p>The name of Neville pronounced by other
lips produced extreme terror. Lady Ennismore
started up, and seized Mrs. Spottiswoode's
hands.</p>

<p>"Don't believe a word of it, Penelope!&mdash;don't
credit that horrible assertion! it is untrue!
As I am looking for the peace which can only
reach me beyond the grave, I never lost my
own respect, or forgot I was a wife!"</p>

<p>"I knew it&mdash;I knew it!&mdash;I never would
believe a word of their vile reports!" exclaimed
Mrs. Spottiswoode, bursting into tears: "but
oh, Julia, your words are balm to my heart!"</p>

<p>"I have flown from treachery, Penelope; and
if you receive me, so will my father. Oh, my
father!&mdash;my poor father!&mdash;you told me your
heart was not in my marriage! I heeded you
not! I clung to my mother's prophecies that I
should be great and happy!"</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore's emotion became alarming;
and it was with some difficulty she was conveyed
into her sister's apartment. She leaned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
upon her friend, and Christobelle assisted in
supporting her trembling form. Christobelle
marked her sister's emotion, and heard her deep
suppressed sobs. The last time she beheld
Julia Wetheral she was led in the pomp and circumstance
of bridal glory, anticipating the excellent
things which wealth and station are supposed
to command.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore was laid upon the bed, and
it was hoped repose would give comparative
tranquillity, but Julia's disease was of the heart:
she could not rest.</p>

<p>"Penelope," she said, as her pale cheek grew
hectic in its deep glow, "I have flown <i>from</i>
Neville!&mdash;I have not flown <i>with</i> him! The
world may say my flight was wrong, but they
cannot say it was infamous!"</p>

<p>"Heed them not who dare say so, Julia. We
are together, and my love shall be your shield
from the world's remarks&mdash;but it will soon distinguish
your innocence&mdash;it will not lay the burthen
on the innocent long. You will be justified
in your action, my own dear friend!"</p>

<p>"I hope so&mdash;I hope so! I fled from my own
heart, too, Penelope; I might have fallen like
others, but I fled from my own heart, and from
persecution. Oh! don't let any one come near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
me but yourself, Penelope. That young lady is
very kind. I told Neville to follow me no more.
Do not persecute me, Neville&mdash;let me alone to
grieve silently. I am unhappy, but I am yet a
guiltless wife. I will go to Penelope...."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore's spirit wandered: fever was
upon her cheek, and she ceased to remember her
own friend.</p>

<p>"I will go to Penelope&mdash;she always loved me,
and she will save her poor friend. I wish I could
get to Lidham! A chaise, Conynham&mdash;a chaise
to the lake-house! If I could only get in&mdash;but
my foot will not move. Lift me in, Conynham,
if you would save me from the Countess!"</p>

<p>A slight shriek broke from Julia's lips, as if
in her vision she had encountered her mother-in-law.
Mrs. Spottiswoode sent instantly for advice,
and she summoned her husband, to consult
with him upon the extraordinary arrival of Lady
Ennismore. While the short interview took
place in her dressing-room, Christobelle sat by
the bed-side of the invalid, who had relapsed into
total forgetfulness of her situation; and she
could gather from her wanderings the nature of
her sufferings, and the reason of her flight from
Bedinfield. It broke Christobelle's heart, to
hear her mournful voice in its ravings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me attend my lord, I beseech you. If
he is ill, who dare close the doors of his apartments
upon his wife? It is my duty to wait
upon my lord&mdash;no, I will not be left whole hours
and days with Neville. I know his kindness and
his love for me. Where is my father? Will
any one seek my father?&mdash;no, Neville, never&mdash;I
am a wife&mdash;a guiltless wife&mdash;do not persecute
me. I will go to Penelope, for she never ceased
to love me&mdash;they are dead, I think&mdash;all that
belong to me are dead!"</p>

<p>Low moanings succeeded, till again Julia burst
forth in complaint, as her ideas dwelt upon the
painful scenes of Bedinfield. All her anxiety
manifested itself in reproaches to Colonel Neville,
and in fancied inability to enter her lord's chamber.
Not one self-reproach mingled among her
moving cries&mdash;all was purity of thought, as Mrs.
Spottiswoode had unceasingly believed and maintained,
in her remarks upon Julia's conduct.</p>

<p>Charles Spottiswoode heard her complaints,
as she rambled in alarm lest the Countess should
intercept her flight to Penelope, and he could
not endure the sound of her voice in sorrow: he
quitted the dressing-room in distress almost as
poignant as that which agonized the heart of his
lady, who sat in silence and in tears, hoping fervently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that the step of the physician would soon
be heard. It was vain to soothe her complaints;
she did not hear the voice of consolation. She
was conversing with herself upon circumstances
which absorbed her attention, and her mind was
evidently in the home she had quitted so eagerly.
He came at last. The voice of Dr. Darwin
sounded in the gallery, and there was hope and
comfort in the knowledge that all would be done
which science and kindness could effect. This
was the second member of the Wetheral family
whom he had attended under circumstances peculiarly
painful.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin at once discovered the secret of Lady
Ennismore's state, and applied himself to give
temporary tranquillity to her disordered mind.
It could be, he said, but temporary rest: he
could not make her forget the sorrow which
raged within, or mitigate her waking grief&mdash;<i>that</i>
must be effected by other hands&mdash;but anodynes
would lull its fury, and bestow rest upon the
frame. Since Lady Ennismore spoke fondly of
her father and Mrs. Spottiswoode, they must be
near her; and, if possible, they should be present
whenever she woke from her unnatural rest.
The sight of esteemed objects was grateful, and
would prevent the immediate recurrence of painful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Wetheral was expected shortly, and he would
advise the constant attendance at present of Mrs.
Spottiswoode alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode remarked that Lady Ennismore
had not recognised Christobelle during the
whole scene. She thought it a remarkable
instance of forgetfulness in a person so nearly
connected. Dr. Darwin considered it only a
proof of the depth of her suffering, which fed
exclusively upon itself. Till the recognition
took place, he prohibited Christobelle's return
into her room, but the sooner it was named to
her ladyship the better&mdash;it would rouse her
attention from more afflicting thoughts.</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin remained at Lidham till the medicine
took effect upon Julia's nerves, and she
sank into sleep. Mrs. Spottiswoode and Christobelle
then sat in the dressing-room, with its
door half closed, and pondered over the event
of the morning. It was too evident that the
Dowager had thrown Colonel Neville constantly
into the society of Julia, and that she had been
debarred all communication with Lord Ennismore.</p>

<p>What could be the reason which prompted the
Dowager to poison the fountain of their domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
peace? It was that insatiable love of power,
which thirsted for entire dominion over the imbecile
mind of her son, and for which every tie,
moral and religious, must be torn asunder. It
was that devouring passion for domination, which
swallowed up every kindly feeling, and bore down
all impediments to its terrific strides. It had
sacrificed the happiness of Julia, the best and
gentlest of created beings&mdash;it had aimed at her
reputation; and, to sever Julia's influence from
her son at one fell swoop, the Countess had endeavoured
to make her a prey to infamy. She
had endeavoured to cause an eternal separation
between two unoffending beings, that her reign
at Bedinfield might be perpetual! She had
succeeded only in driving Julia from her husband's
house. Oh, Power! how gradually and
wickedly do its votaries consume every right
principle, to feed its fiercely-burning fires!</p>

<p>Christobelle saw Spottiswoode but once after
her sister's mournful entrance into Lidham, and
she was too much overpowered with regret to
enjoy his society. She could not recall her
thoughts from Julia, to concentrate them even
upon him&mdash;but he was also in low spirits. His
feeling heart sympathised in the general sorrow,
and they mourned together over the fallen hopes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and the short career of Julia's brilliant prospects.
Like a shooting star, she had fallen from the
altitudes of a princely marriage, to the cold,
dark nothingness of disappointed earthly pleasures.
How Christobelle mourned over her
brightly gay sister, whom she remembered so
lovely and so loved! She did not remain long
with Spottiswoode. She left him, to pass the
evening and night in her dressing-room, to assist
Mrs. Spottiswoode in her cares, and to think of
Julia.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>Lady Ennismore's illness was long in its continuance
and severe in its effects. Mrs. Spottiswoode
watched over her with unceasing and
affecting attention; and it was often painful to
witness her agonized fears, lest her friend should
sink beneath the combined attacks of mental and
bodily suffering. It was sad to look upon a
creature so changed as Julia, and hear her touching
exclamations under the effects of almost constant
delirium. It was heart-rending to hear
her call upon Lady Ennismore with passionate
entreaties, demanding admittance to her lord,
and imploring her to save her from Neville&mdash;it
was still more touching to hear her imprecate
sorrow upon the head of those who could lure a
desolate wife to her destruction.</p>

<p>The sight of Dr. Darwin terrified the invalid
for many days. She addressed him as Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Neville, and her wandering fancy conceived that
Colonel Neville was seeking an interview. She
waved him from the room with an impetuous
movement, and implored him to leave an unhappy
wife in peace. She said he knew she loved him&mdash;he
knew she loved the friend who was kind to
her when all others had deserted her, but she
commanded him to fly from her!&mdash;she was the
wife of Lord Ennismore, and no power on earth
should induce her to listen to him. "If her
father was alive to protect her," she said, "he
would shelter her from woe and treachery&mdash;but
all were gone who ever loved her, and she would
go to her long lost friend Penelope."</p>

<p>It was evident Lady Ennismore had flown from
Bedinfield to escape from her own heart, as she
avowed to Mrs. Spottiswoode. It was evident,
also, that the Dowager-countess had acted an
unholy part by her daughter, in throwing her
constantly into the society of Colonel Neville,
and barring her entrance into the apartments of
her sickly and weak-minded husband. Such
cruelty towards an innocent and trusting creature
affected the heart of Mrs. Spottiswoode
almost to illness: her mind dwelt long and
strongly upon the distress of heart, which must
have been endured by her friend before she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
have fled from her husband's house; and Mr.
Spottiswoode became alarmed lest his wife's
health should fall a sacrifice to her devoted attachment
to the friend of her early days.</p>

<p>In this time of severe trial to all parties, Sir
John Spottiswoode acted with the kindest consideration;
and he undertook to meet Sir John
Wetheral upon his arrival, and break to him the
mournful intelligence of Lady Ennismore's situation.
Before his arrival, however, her ladyship
had regained her consciousness of all that was
passing round her, and the parched fever, which
consumed her animal powers, yielded to the judicious
treatment of her medical adviser. Julia
again recognized her friend, and again received
pleasure in feeling herself watched over and
protected by those she loved. Her weakness
was excessive, and her mind still dwelt upon the
sorrow which oppressed her; but it was no
longer accompanied by that fearful aberration of
intellect, which wasted her strength, and tore
the hearts of those who witnessed its effects.
Mrs. Spottiswoode passed her waking hours at
her friend's side, for it was a cordial to Julia's
spirit to see her near, and to know Penelope was
watching over her; but Christobelle was deputed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to guard her short and uneasy slumbers. It was
a period of deep and trembling anxiety.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral's cares were crowding upon
him. He had been destined for some years to
witness the shattered nerves and depressed spirits
of his lady, and he was now called upon to witness
the sufferings of Julia, and to support her
through the difficulties of her situation. It was
a severe trial to his feelings; but he met the intelligence
with fortitude. His unworldly actions
caused no self-reproach, and he had never sacrificed
his sense of right to the idols of a vain imagination,
therefore his regrets, however bitter,
were untinged by the gloomy reflection that his
own hand had barbed the arrow which struck
his heart.</p>

<p>Not so Lady Wetheral. The intelligence of
Julia's flight to Lidham prostrated her to the
earth, and bowed down all her hopes. She confined
herself to her own room, and talked incessantly
to Mrs. Bevan of the misery which overpowered
her. "She had done such things for
Clara and Julia!&mdash;she had formed, and prosecuted,
and brought into effect, plans for their
advancement, which should have raised them far
above their companions; yet they were dashed
to the ground, after such anxieties and fears!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
The daughters whom she peculiarly considered
under her own rule had proved themselves unequal
to enjoy the exalted situations she had
marked out for them; and Bell, a perfect child,
fostered among the wild hills of Lochleven, had
presumed to refuse a dukedom, in order to follow
her mean affections, and content herself with a
small estate in Worcestershire! What was Julia,
now? A truant wife&mdash;a woman, so lost to propriety,
that her future position in people's minds
must be equivocal&mdash;a creature who would in
future be gazed upon as a deserter from Bedinfield.
Such was the fate of those who created
scenes!&mdash;a world's wonder, and a thing of
nought!" A period of silence would ensue,
subsequent to each irritable complaint; and
Lady Wetheral would sink into deep fits of
despondency, followed by sudden reaction, which
threatened to undermine her constitution.</p>

<p>When Julia became sufficiently calm to bear
the sight of a third person without alarm, Christobelle
was silently admitted to her presence,
and was recognized immediately with a joy
which gave unfeigned satisfaction to Mrs. Spottiswoode.
It seemed as if Lady Ennismore's
spirit was not dead to emotions which must
eventually lure her thoughts from melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
images, and reconcile her to life. Lady Ennismore
fixed her eyes upon her sister with a momentary
expression of delight, which gradually
changed into sadness, and the tears stole down
her cheeks. She pressed her hand to her heart.
"Chrystal," she said, "when I saw you last, I
was not as I am now!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode embraced her, and bade
her think of happier times. Julia looked at her
with eyes swimming in tears.</p>

<p>"Penelope, it soothes me to talk of the past,
for my sorrow has been confined too painfully to
my own bosom. Let me tell Chrystal how useless
were the aids of grandeur and gratified ambition
to give comfort to a breaking heart. It
may make her less careful of the follies of worldly
gifts&mdash;less ambitious than I was. Yet, I loved
him; I loved Ennismore, once; but what heart
will love through coldness&mdash;through indifference,
and separation? Who can love, when kindly
affections are thrown aside, or made the sport
of unfeeling ridicule? Chrystal, marry not, unless
you are sure you are valued&mdash;unless you
love a man for the goodness of his nature, and
not for his earthly possessions."</p>

<p>Christobelle bent forward, and pressed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
lips upon Julia's hand, as it lay upon her own.
She could not speak.</p>

<p>"If they tell you, Chrystal, that life has no
blessings beyond high station and the luxuries
of wealth, look at me, and believe them not. It
is false to say so. My father told me it was
false, and I did not heed him. I smiled at his
anxiety, and thought him prejudiced. Where is
my father?&mdash;Where is my dear father? Is he
alive, Penelope? Oh, do not say that good
father is gone, who mourned so, after my hapless
choice was made&mdash;who looked so calm and
so sad at Bedinfield!"</p>

<p>Christobelle assured her every member of the
family still lived, and then she repeated to her
the message which her father had charged her
to deliver when Julia's returning reason could
bear its import. It was a message of kindness:
they were words of indulgent goodness, for none
other ever passed <i>his</i> lips. "Tell my poor Julia,"
he said, "that her father's eyes long to behold
her, and his arms are open to embrace her, when
she can bear the meeting. There is a home at
Wetheral, to shelter her; and his fond affections
are anxious to make her forget she ever left its
protection." Julia wept abundantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we resist advice, and defy the truths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to reason upon things which concern our peace
hereafter. I believed my mother-in-law was all
truth&mdash;all sincerity. I felt for Lord Ennismore's
ailments. I did not know how deeply those ailments
affect the temper and weaken the mind.
I was ambitious&mdash;I was resolved to soar: and
see, Chrystal, how I have fallen! Thank Heaven,
I am guiltless!&mdash;thank Heaven, I can return to
my father's house, untainted by crime! I shall
never more be happy, but I can demand respect,
and bow submissively to a just punishment for
my sordid views. I fancied I could command
all, as the wife of Ennismore! but I came to
Penelope's house&mdash;a poor, solitary, wretched
wife&mdash;a fugitive from Bedinfield&mdash;flying, above
all, from myself. Oh, my friend, my dear Penelope,
save me from myself!"</p>

<p>"Fear not," replied Mrs. Spottiswoode, kneeling
by her bed-side, and clasping Julia's hands in
her own, "fear not, my companion and friend!
I will be with you, and my counsel and affection
shall support you. Think no more of the past,
but hope every thing from the future: forget all
that has occurred, and look around you, upon
the friends of your youth, all prepared to welcome
and cherish you, dearest Julia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I <i>could</i> forget&mdash;I wish I could struggle,
and burst the bonds which destroy my tranquillity,
Penelope! I wish I could wipe away
remembrances which will embitter my existence,
and which have shortened the days of my youth,
and multiplied my sorrows&mdash;how I wish I <i>could</i>
forget!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode signed to Christobelle to
withdraw, and she retired into the dressing-room.
Penelope continued kneeling, and embracing
the hands of her complaining friend.</p>

<p>"Julia, open your heart to your old favourite,
and remember there was a time when we never
concealed a thought from each other's knowledge."</p>

<p>Julia gasped and trembled.</p>

<p>"Julia, your friend has guessed the struggles
you have endured, and your flight has increased
her love and high respect, if it could allow an
increase. It is not every ill-used wife&mdash;it is not
every desolate heart&mdash;that could have flown from
Neville." Julia's hands became cold as marble
in Mrs. Spottiswoode's grasp, and she turned her
face from her friend's gaze in terror.</p>

<p>"Julia," continued Mrs. Spottiswoode, "by
every recollection of our childhood passed together&mdash;by
the tenderness which ever existed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
between us, and by our attachment, which has
survived absence and silence, open your heart to
your poor Penelope! It is only known to Chrystal
and myself, that your temptations have been
severe, and your virtue severer still. It is to our
bosoms alone that your confessions have been
made, Julia; and we love, with a deeper feeling
of esteem, the virtues we could not emulate under
the same trial. Do not speak in humility to <i>us</i>&mdash;do
not fear to boast of the victory over your
own heart!"</p>

<p>"Have I then been delirious, Penelope? Have
I spoken of him in bitterness? Have I said any
thing of Ennismore in anger? I have no anger
towards him. He was but weak and devoted to
his mother. My father cautioned me! I have
no excuse, Penelope. How anxiously my father
cautioned me, and how stupidly I rejected the
caution!"</p>

<p>"You were young, Julia; you could not suspect
an artful and cold-hearted woman!"</p>

<p>"So we say, when a parent's anxiety has been
scoffed at, and we are crushed by a dreadful experience.
I knew my father's indulgence&mdash;I
knew his fears for my happiness&mdash;yet I turned
to listen to the dictates of a wretched ambition.
Oh, my mother, my mother, <i>you</i> sacrificed me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia sank upon the pillow from which she had
risen with a strong effort, and continued, in faltering
accents&mdash;"Penelope, did I mention another
name? If I did, have mercy on me, and
forbear to judge your friend! You do not know
how I have striven to do right!"</p>

<p>"I do know it, my beloved, I do know it&mdash;" exclaimed
Mrs. Spottiswoode, "and I guessed it,
before your overcharged heart declared it in delirium.
I, your friend, know it; and may those
who have shadowed your days with evil, drink
deep of the cup they prepared for you, Julia!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother, my mother!" cried Julia,
"how could you guide me into misery! How
could I think you were preparing sorrow for the
child who loved and believed in your words!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode wept over the friend who
lay prostrate, in body and mind, before her.
Julia essayed to rise, but her exhaustion was too
great; she could only press the hand of her
faithful friend.</p>

<p>"Penelope, as you love me, never name even
to myself the horrible secret of my soul. Let it
be for ever forgotten between us, and strengthen
me by your wise counsel and friendship, my own
blessed companion of once happy days!"</p>

<p>"Rest, rest, Julia," said Mrs. Spottiswoode,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
"and do not exert your failing strength. I understand
you. We will in future only speak of
calm days, and look forward to the sober pleasures
of friendship. Among your friends, the
friends of your youth, Julia, there will be peace."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore shook her head, and the tears
which trickled through her closed eyelids evinced
her hopelessness of future tranquillity, but she
remained silent. Mrs. Spottiswoode kissed her
pale cheek.</p>

<p>"Exert yourself no more, dearest Julia. I
know all that is passing in your heart, and its
struggles for oblivion upon the past. Weep not,
my ill-used friend&mdash;my heart shall comfort you,
and my love shall heal the wounds of betrayed
affection. You do not know the hearts which
are rallying round you, and are only waiting
your convalescence to declare themselves your
sympathising and devoted friends. Be at rest,
my dearest Julia&mdash;I fear for the consequences
of this weakening conversation. Try to be
composed and sleep, to quiet your poor friend's
alarms."</p>

<p>But the conversation had not weakened Lady
Ennismore. Her spirit was lightened by the
knowledge that her secret was discovered, and
that her friend still loved and honoured her with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
unabated affection. It was a relief to her heart,
to feel assured that her friend did not judge her
severely; but that, with true friendship, she had
poured balm upon her broken hopes, and sympathised
in her sufferings. The load of care which
pressed upon her mind and strength was cast
upon the confiding friend of her youth, whose
consolations soothed and tranquillized the sorrow
which had consumed her. The husband, for
whom she had quitted her home and friends,
had caused many miseries; but the hand of
friendship had supported her. What woe is not
assuaged by that gentle and cheering consolation!&mdash;that
gift accorded by Providence to soften
the ills of a patient and submissive spirit!</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore wept silently for some time,
but she did not weep with the bitterness which
destroys rest. Doubtless, her tears fell with
mingled feelings of joy and grief; doubtless,
her heart was filled with grateful thanks, that
her destiny was yet cheered by the consolations
of tender and affectionate friends; doubtless,
she wept to feel the tears of Penelope upon her
cheek; that Penelope Wycherly, whom <i>she</i> had
befriended in her hour of affliction, and who had
shared with her the joys and fears of childhood.
No wonder Lady Ennismore wept! though her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
emotion ceased to be of that distressing nature
which gave her friends so much pain to witness.
It was weeping which relieved her heart, and
produced favourable results; for she became
gradually more tranquil, and her pale thin hand
relaxing in its grasp, gave happy assurance to
Mrs. Spottiswoode that her unhappy friend slumbered.</p>

<p>When Dr. Darwin called again at Lidham,
Lady Ennismore still slept and lay composed.
From that moment Julia's most distressing symptoms
disappeared, but she suffered from a languor
which was oppressive; a languor which
pervaded mind and body to such a powerful degree,
that she scarcely seemed to exist. It had
one excellent result. Lady Ennismore ceased
to suffer pain: it was a state apparently of perfect
torpor, caused by intense distress, and its
tranquillity must be to her enjoyment. She
ceased to feel the extent of her misery.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral's visits to Lidham were of
daily occurrence; he longed to clasp his poor
fugitive to his heart; but Lady Ennismore's
present situation required care, and all agitating
interviews were prohibited. It was only when
the torpor which had seized upon her became
alarming by its continuance, that her father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
presence was advised, to try its effect upon her
mind. If that interview did not awaken her
powers, it was feared that nothing henceforth
would rouse her from the stillness of death, till
she forgot for ever the cares which had disturbed
her short pilgrimage. Mrs. Spottiswoode urged
the interview with anxious hope: she knew
Julia's strong affections, and she felt firmly convinced
that if any earthly object <i>could</i> rouse her,
it would be the sight of her indulgent parent.
Sir John Wetheral was accordingly summoned
to appear unexpectedly before Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>Julia was seated in her arm-chair, with her
eyes fixed on the ground, when Christobelle
entered her chamber in the evening; but, as
usual, no sign of recognition took place. Miss
Wetheral advanced towards her sister, and offered
her arm. "Julia, let us take one turn round
the room."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore rose without speaking, and
mechanically took the arm of Christobelle, but
she did not raise her eyes. Miss Wetheral spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Julia, look there!"</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore's eye slowly followed the
direction of her sister's hand, which pointed towards
the door. A scream burst from her lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and she flew into his arms. The sight of her
father <i>did</i> rouse every recollection!</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell upon a scene so fraught
with distress, or to describe the affecting interview.
It would be painful to repeat Lady Ennismore's
self-upbraidings, or to recount her
father's soothing, and most parental words of
comfort. He welcomed his Julia to his heart
and home, with endearments which went deep
into her grateful heart, and spoke peace to her
broken spirit. It was a scene which Mrs. Spottiswoode
and Christobelle never forgot. The
tears they shed that evening bore testimony to
their deep emotion.</p>

<p>When Sir John Wetheral and his daughter
became more tranquil, Mrs. Spottiswoode would
have terminated the interview, but Julia clung
to her father's arm, and would not be separated
from him. She would now, she said, open her
heart to those so dear to her, that the work of a
long absence might be confided to her parent's
breast, and he should judge if her flight was
rashly done. Mrs. Spottiswoode feared a relapse;
but Julia would not hear of rest. "Let
me speak now, Penelope, while my spirit is
equal to the task. I may be ill, but my story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
must be told; my father must be told; it will
be a relief to know I need recur to the past no
more. Let me speak <i>now</i>, Penelope."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore recapitulated the events which
had taken place since her father's visit to Bedinfield,
and described her distress at finding he
had departed without bidding her farewell. "Her
mother-in-law had assured her so calmly that
they <i>would</i> depart, and declined remaining another
day to ascertain my lord's sudden attack, that
she could not disbelieve the assertion, and the
thought had given her severe pain. Profound
silence, too, rested upon the transactions at Wetheral;
not once had she received a letter from
the home which professed to love her so tenderly.
Not once did they acknowledge the numberless
letters she had written, to entreat their consideration,
and to implore them to answer her
anxieties.</p>

<p>"After her father's departure from Bedinfield,
as she thought, so coldly, so unkindly! her heart
sank, and she became gloomy. Her lord received
her as a stranger into his apartments
during an illness of long continuance, while the
Dowager remained stationed by his side, and her
spirits could not endure the insulting banishment.
She prayed to visit her home, to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
again her friend Miss Wycherly, to ask the
reason of their silence, and demand their withdrawn
affection. Her request was refused; but
it was done so gently, so persuasively by her
mother-in-law, that she could only weep while
she acquiesced in their wishes to remain at Bedinfield.</p>

<p>"She began to fear Lord Ennismore did not
love her; she began to suspect the politeness
of his mother, whose manners had so long
blinded her reason by their soft fascinations, but
who had never, in a single instance, yielded to
her wishes, or considered her rights as the real
mistress of Bedinfield. That unchangingly-polite
and flattering suavity had proved the
firmest bar to her happiness; for it had left her
without the power of complaint, while her heart
was wrung with disappointed feelings. They
had carried her almost broken-hearted to Florence."</p>

<p>Julia stopped; deep sighs burst from her
bosom, and her head fell upon the shoulder of
Mrs. Spottiswoode: her father became powerfully
agitated; and Christobelle wept, without
the power of controlling her tears. Lady Ennismore
proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Florence, a complete separation was silently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
effected between Lord Ennismore and
herself. His lordship confined himself entirely
to his suite of apartments, and months often
elapsed without an interview. Sometimes he
accompanied them into public, but he would
retire complaining from the exertion; and,
though her own spirits demanded retirement,
and even solitude, his lordship's commands were
imperative upon her to appear with his mother
at all the diversions where English families attended.</p>

<p>"She became at length a mere machine in the
hands of the Dowager Countess. Without one
friend to consult&mdash;absent from her nearest relations&mdash;unable
to speak the language of the
country&mdash;melancholy and careless of existence,
she followed her mother-in-law into society without
enjoyment, and retired from it without satisfaction.
Her days became a blank, and she
passed hours in silent weeping. At length an
Englishman was introduced to her by the Dowager,
who pitied her situation, and sought to
amuse her heavy hours with news of her native
land. He told her he had seen her sister Clara's
marriage with Sir Foster Kerrison in the papers,
and he had also seen the mention of her death.
By this statement alone she knew that Clara was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
no more. No letter from England announced
it, no intimation from her family informed her
of a sister's loss. She stood alone in the midst
of her greatness. There were none to do her a
kindness, or to offer her the consolation which
was tendered to the humblest individual; none
save that Englishman spoke to her of home; none
save him came forth from the crowd, to speak
of her country and her friends."</p>

<p>Julia's emotion increased, and she was nearly
fainting, but she waved away all assistance. "Let
me say what I have to communicate, my dear
friends, and then I will be silent for ever on all
that is past. Ah! my dear papa, you told me
I was signing your misery, when I would not
listen to your words. You told me you would
rather follow my silent remains to the grave
than see me the wife of Ennismore. Would
to Heaven I <i>had</i> died! I should now be at
rest."</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral pressed his unhappy daughter
to his bosom, and promised her rest under
his own protection, and in the society of her
friends. He wished her to defer her hapless
story till time had somewhat recruited her
strength; she was too weak to proceed in detailing
miseries which must distress and exhaust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
her powers. He entreated her, for his sake and
her own, to recur no more to the past.</p>

<p>"Let me proceed," cried Lady Ennismore,
"and judge me not hardly; judge me as Penelope
judged me, kindly and graciously. I saw little
of my husband&mdash;never, in private. Lady Ennismore
could have effected any thing with her
son, but she smiled at my repinings, and did
not comfort me. She urged me to be gay, to
shake off gloomy thoughts in wild amusement,
and smile as others smiled. She sought Colonel
Neville's society, and domesticated him in our
palace. Wherever we went, he went also; and
our home was the home of Neville."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore sunk upon her knees before
her father, and clasped his hands.</p>

<p>"As I live to breathe again my native air,
and see the forms I love, I do believe she wished
me to become the prey of evil passions, and fall
a victim to her arts! I do believe she trusted
I might be thrust for ever from her sight, and
become the vile thing which would banish me
eternally from a husband's presence. But I was
enabled to withstand temptation. I prayed for
strength to endure my destiny: and, when I
dared not confide in my own efforts&mdash;when my
heart was distracted, and my principles tottered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
then I knew I should find help at Lidham; for
Penelope told me, in sickness or in sorrow, her
home should be my home; and I have flown to
her for safety."</p>

<p>Poor suffering Julia! How she trembled as
her father raised her from her suppliant attitude,
and called her his long-suffering, virtuous child!
How gratefully she raised her eyes in silent
prayer, when her father gloried in her principles,
and said he loved her with a parent's deepest
affection and pride, for the danger she had so religiously
withstood. Yes, he blessed her for
the firmness she had evinced, for the virtuous
conduct which had not deserted her, and for the
prayerful spirit which had led her to seek refuge
in her God, instead of throwing herself into the
arms of man. How did a father's blessing soothe
the lacerated heart of the ill-used Julia!</p>

<p>From the hour of her confession, Lady Ennismore
became more tranquil; and, though her
constitution had received a powerful shock, it was
hoped that time would bring back some portion
of her once excellent health. Sir John Wetheral
resolved to escort his daughters to their home as
soon as Lady Ennismore could endure a removal;
and, under the shelter of the parental roof, Julia
would feel protected from the sorrows which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
surrounded by her friends, and in its sanctuary
she would feel no more the slights and insults
which had pressed so heavily upon her affectionate
heart. Mrs. Spottiswoode's near neighbourhood,
and the friendship which had formed so
conspicuous a part of her character, would throw
a halo of consolation round the futurity of Julia;
and when her father and her friends congregated
round her, the breath of public opinion
dared not whisper a thought injurious to her
honour.</p>

<p>As Lady Ennismore slowly recovered the tone
of her mind, her anxiety to hear of her family
increased, and she was gradually informed of the
changes which had taken place. Her ladyship
had greatly wondered at Lady Wetheral's absence
from her room, and she mourned sincerely
to hear her mother's shattered health kept her
closely confined at the castle. Clara's death was
also detailed to her, and Lady Ennismore wept
to hear that her sister had striven with evil days.
She dwelt with constant and painful interest
upon her short career.</p>

<p>It seemed that Clara and herself had been
doomed to woe; and, though she smiled to
think of Isabel's happiness, and loved to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
thoughts flew back to the direful scenes at
Ripley, and sorrowed for the early death of
Lady Kerrison. The remembrance of Clara
drew Julia's contemplations from her own exclusive
situation; and her tears would flow, to
think of the sister whose temper could not
brook the calls upon its patience. How different
had been their fate, yet how alike in
misery! She herself had borne daily and
hourly provocations with unfailing submission,
while Clara had spurned to tax her patience
under trials, and died beneath her roused disgusts.
Both had suffered&mdash;both had fallen;
but Clara had burst the bonds which fettered
her happiness, and she was resting in her early
grave; while <i>she</i> was doomed to exist a widowed
wife, and struggle under contumely!</p>

<p>When Lady Ennismore heard of Christobelle's
engagement, she threw her arms around her
youthful sister, and pressed her to her bosom,
but she could not wish her joy.</p>

<p>"Chrystal," she said, with a look of sadness,
"I can wish no one joy when they quit their
home, for I was congratulated by all my friends,
yet my portion was the cup of bitterness! I
know Sir John Spottiswoode is worthy&mdash;at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
least, it is reported so&mdash;but it is all uncertainty.
When we quit our father's house, we know not
what we do!"</p>

<p>"But I am not marrying for wealth or title,
Julia; I am engaged to a man whose claims to
my affection is his worth and excellence!"</p>

<p>Christobelle stood in distress at her inadvertent
speech; for worlds she would not have bruised
a broken reed; for worlds she would not wound
the heart of her suffering sister. But Lady
Ennismore was too high-minded to believe a
blow was aimed at her own conduct.</p>

<p>"It is true, Chrystal, you say it truly. You
<i>have</i> chosen a good and kind-hearted man,
and your fate will not be like mine. I <i>can</i>,
therefore, wish you joy. May you know only
indulgence, and be as Isabel and Anna Maria
are! I can wish you no higher felicity. But I
have caused much trouble, for you have devoted
your time to a poor creature who feels deeply
the kindness of her friends, and who grieves to
separate the happy. Where is Sir John Spottiswoode?"</p>

<p>Sir John Spottiswoode was at Alverton. He
devoted the period of Christobelle's constant
attendance upon Lady Ennismore, to the arrangement
of his affairs in Worcestershire; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
when Julia's health released her sister from the
cares of a sick room, Christobelle was to recal
him. Miss Wetheral was easier also when she
knew her lover was not near her. She could
give undivided attention to her poor Julia, when
she did not hear his step lingering in the gallery,
or distinguish his voice under the windows,
in conversation with his brother. On both sides
it was a relief to part at once, till they could
meet in peace. Their mutual comfort was destroyed
by the knowledge that, though under
the same roof, they could only meet in short
and hurried interviews; and Christobelle rejoiced
when her friend summoned resolution to
visit Alverton.</p>

<p>Charles Spottiswoode also departed with his
brother for a short season, and Lidham was the
scene of perfect tranquillity during the distressing
illness of Lady Ennismore. For the sake
of Mr. Spottiswoode, who so generously relinquished
his lady's society to her unfortunate
friend, Sir John Wetheral hastened to withdraw
with his daughters from Lidham, and Lady Ennismore
sighed to see again the home of her
early happiness, and to find repose in the once
gay halls of Wetheral. Christobelle was, therefore,
deputed to recal Sir John Spottiswoode,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and she was charged also to summon him to
Wetheral Castle. Ere he could arrive, Julia
would be re-established in her father's house,
and the painful events which had taken place
would, it was hoped, become softened by time,
and the society of her early friends.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore could not be expected to
forget that "such things were;" but there was
blessedness in feeling that her youthful error
had not been accompanied by guilt, and that
her sorrows could not be past hope, since she
was free from self-reproach. She had endeavoured
to perform the duties of a wife&mdash;she had
keenly felt the influence which separated her
from her husband's love&mdash;and every art had
failed to render her faithless to her vows. In
all these reflections there was consolation, and
Julia's reward was in the love and esteem of her
numerous and attached friends.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral wrote a calm and powerful
appeal to the heart of the feeble-minded Lord
Ennismore. He spoke of "his daughter's sufferings&mdash;her
forbearance&mdash;and her return to the
protection denied by her husband. He informed
him of his resolution to protect that daughter
whose fame must suffer by his barbarous treatment;
and never more would he allow her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
her feelings, and her spotless reputation. He
begged to say all future intercourse must end
for ever between the families of Ennismore and
Wetheral."</p>

<p>In due time a note was received, in the handwriting
of the Dowager-countess, bearing these
concise sentences:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Dowager-countess of Ennismore regrets
that the increased disorder of her son, Lord Ennismore,
must compel her to become his amanuensis.
The flight of Lady Ennismore is best
known to herself; and the flight of Colonel
Neville, at the same period, is also best understood
by her ladyship. Lord Ennismore is content
to remain deserted by his lady, and his
mother will endeavour to supply her place by
devoted attention to his offended and outraged
feelings. Lady Ennismore is happy, if not
respectable, in being upheld by her friends.
The families of Bedinfield and Wetheral will
meet no more."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This note was dated from Florence, and its
contents were withheld from Julia. It would
have caused the wounds of her heart to bleed
afresh. It was better for her peace of mind, to
remain in ignorance of Neville's flight, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
be unconscious of the remark which pointed to
her fame.</p>

<p>Julia declined seeing even Mrs. Pynsent, till
her nerves had recovered their tone by long
quiet, and till she had seen her mother. It
would be a painful meeting with Anna Maria,
because their last interview was at the altar,
and that event had sealed their lives to prospects
strangely opposed to each other. Anna Maria
had given her vows to the man whom Julia rejected,
and her lot was cast in a goodly heritage.
She was a happy wife&mdash;a happy mother&mdash;and
her children were growing up round her, under
happy auspices: but Julia had returned home,
to be protected from those who had vowed to
love and honour her. It would be a very
overpowering and painful meeting; it would
force recollections upon her mind, fatal to her
tranquillity; and the first sight of Anna Maria's
happy face would, for some time, overthrow the
placidity which she had acquired under the
gentle soothings and support of Mrs. Spottiswoode.
Julia contemplated the meeting with
alarm, and in tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode accompanied Sir John
Wetheral and Christobelle, as they escorted
Lady Ennismore to the home of her singlehood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Julia did not speak during the little
journey; but her eyes filled with tears, as they
rested on each well-known object in her route.
Her emotion was excessive as the carriage
entered the Lodges of Wetheral, and the
avenue produced a thousand reminiscences of
the past, which occasioned a strong hysteric.
But there were those near her who tempered
the blow to the sufferer, and softened her regrets
by kind commiseration. Her father's voice
alone appeared to fail in bringing calm to her
heart.</p>

<p>"Let me not hear that voice!" she exclaimed,
"for it brings to my mind how mournfully
it implored me to avoid repentance!
Every thing I see remains unchanged; it is only
Clara and myself who were doomed to sink into
death and wretchedness! My mother&mdash;cruel
mother!&mdash;it is all my mother!" Oppressed
with grief, Julia sank into silence, and she
suffered herself to be carried into the rooms
which once constituted the sleeping apartments
and dressing-room of herself and Anna Maria.
Julia placed her hand upon her heart, but she
did not give utterance to her thoughts, as she
glanced round upon well-remembered furniture,
and fixed her eyes upon the large mirror which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
had reflected her gay appearance upon her
bridal-morn. Mrs. Spottiswoode, her bridesmaid,
stood by her; and her father held her
hand, as he had affectionately held it when she
kneeled to receive his blessing as Julia Ennismore.</p>

<p>This powerful picture of the past affected her
heart. She threw herself at her father's feet.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!&mdash;forgive my obstinate presumption,
papa! I feel how truly you spoke!
how blindly I followed my own judgment!
This is a bitter stroke to me! All are here
who did not advocate my ambitious choice!&mdash;but
where are they who told me I should be
greatly envied? Where is my mother, who
prophecied worldly happiness, and told me I
was right to persevere? Who assured me of
bright realities, and years of happy freedom?"</p>

<p>Julia rose from her kneeling attitude, and
the expression of her eyes was fearfully wild,
as she held out her hands to her father.</p>

<p>"Why did she tell me my father loved lowly
things, and could not comprehend a woman's
heart? Why did she tell me Ennismore was
easily influenced, and that a wife's word would
supersede a mother's management? Has it been
so? Have I not suffered scorn, and ridicule,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>

and banishment, in silence? Have I not endured
a thousand regrets&mdash;a thousand struggles&mdash;a
thousand insults?"</p>

<p>Julia paused as her eye again wandered over
the mirror, and she saw the reflection of her
own wasted figure and pale countenance. For
one moment her whole attention was engrossed
by the change which had taken place in her
person. She gazed at her thin form, and raised
her hands to examine the wasted fingers which
had lost their once plump roundness and extreme
beauty. She then fled from the apartment.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>


<p>Sorrows, renewed by the associations which
pressed upon her mind, impelled Lady Ennismore
to seek her mother's apartments. Mrs.
Bevan was attending her mistress, and Julia's
noiseless step glided across the carpeted floor of
the dressing-room, where Lady Wetheral lay extended
on the sofa, complaining to her attendant
of her own wretched feelings.</p>

<p>"Bevan, I am very ill to-day: I cannot see
Mrs. Tom Pynsent, or admit any one. My
nerves become worse and worse, and I am in a
dreadful state of tremour at this moment. I
cannot hold my salts bottle, it falls out of my
poor nervous fingers&mdash;I am very ill to-day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bevan spoke pleasing words of comfort,
but her ladyship rejected them.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Bevan. I hate to hear
people say things which are not likely to occur.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
How can I expect to be well, when Miss Wetheral
obstinately defies my wishes, and all my
children are determined to fly in my face? I
had a dream, too, last night, which increases my
disorder; I dreamt I saw Lady Ennismore brilliantly
dressed, walking in a procession; and
she walked so stately in jewels, and her rank
placed her so high among the great ones, that I
was proud of my daughter, and I smiled to see
her in grandeur. Poor Julia, where is she
<i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>"She is here," exclaimed Lady Ennismore,
standing before her mother, with her thin hands
crossed upon her bosom; "here is the envied
Countess of Ennismore!"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral gazed upon the vision in dumb
amazement.</p>

<p>"Look at me," continued Julia, "look at my
figure, and tell me if you believed all this would
come to pass? When you assured me that
wealth and rank was happiness and virtue, did
you think I should return a fugitive, to seek
shelter at your hands?"</p>

<p>"Julia!" gasped Lady Wetheral, "Julia!
go! who are <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Go?" exclaimed Lady Ennismore, "where
shall I go? To Clara? Shall I rest with poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
peace after my sacrifice, my absence, and my
griefs?"</p>

<p>The tremour which attacked Lady Wetheral's
frame was alarming. It precluded speech: she
hid her face with her hands, as Lady Ennismore
proceeded.</p>

<p>"For quitting a husband's home, I may be
censured and avoided by the world, for it may
never know my provocations and my struggles,
but I should not be turned from my mother's
presence! I should not be banished by the
author of all my misery, as if she had no part in
the misery which I endure!"</p>

<p>"Do not say so&mdash;oh, do not say so! Do not
blame me, as Clara did!" Lady Wetheral sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>"I reproach no one," answered Lady Ennismore,
mournfully. "I reproach no one, though
I was promised happiness as the wife of Ennismore.
Where is that happiness? You foretold
it, mother. You said I should for ever enjoy
wealth and station, and become the envied gaze
of thousands! Where is it all?"</p>

<p>"Cease, cease!" cried Lady Wetheral, wrung
by feelings of alarm and self-reproach. "I
wished you to marry Pynsent, Julia!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cruel mother," exclaimed Lady Ennismore,
as she caught her hand, and looked earnestly in
her face, "do not say so, to drive me wilder
than my poor brain feels now! Did you not
hold up Ennismore to my view, as a creature to
worship? Did you not tell me his coronet was
worth a daring grasp, if I could gain the courtly
bauble? Oh, you bid me secure the lofty establishment,
and I did so, and have suffered! I
wish I was with poor dead Clara! We both
turned from our father, and would not heed his
mild precepts. We listened to projects which
suited our ambitious nature, though he deprecated
the unholy passion. Oh, mother, you fostered
the wild and dangerous feeling! I wish I
was laid by the side of Clara! I wish I was at
rest, like her!"</p>

<p>"Bevan, Bevan," ejaculated Lady Wetheral,
"where are you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bevan curtseyed as she stood in mute
astonishment behind her lady's sofa. She was
unable to speak: her eyes were riveted upon
Lady Ennismore, who still grasped her mother's
hand, and still continued her wild address.</p>

<p>"This has been a fearful affair! Two of us
have fallen&mdash;one into the grave, and one into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
home. Is it not a fearful thing?"</p>

<p>"Do not blame me, as Clara did&mdash;do not
blame me for your flight, Julia," said Lady
Wetheral, endeavouring to withdraw her hand,
but Lady Ennismore clasped it more closely.</p>

<p>"I blame no one&mdash;but two of us are lost for
ever. I blame no one!"</p>

<p>"I detested scenes&mdash;I ever detested scenes,
Julia!" Lady Wetheral rose into a sitting posture
as she spoke. "I warned you from the beginning,
all of you, never to offend me by violent
measures, which draw down ridicule and
disgust. Clara and yourself were married greatly,
Julia!"</p>

<p>"Where has been our greatness?" said Lady
Ennismore, despondingly.</p>

<p>"You were both placed in affluence," retorted
her mother, with nervous trepidation, "and
your high positions were exalted above your
companions. You were greatly married&mdash;that
was <i>my</i> doing: but you have thrown yourselves
from the pinnacle of earthly honours&mdash;and that
was <i>your</i> doing!"</p>

<p>"Mother, I have been betrayed, banished
from my husband's presence&mdash;unhappy, and uncared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
hand, and sinking upon the floor in despair.</p>

<p>"I told you," continued Lady Wetheral, becoming
almost vehement in her manner, "I
told you many things might occur to distress
your heart, but nothing could arise to make you
an object of ridicule to the world, except your
own folly. You have flown from Lord Ennismore's
house&mdash;who will receive you? who receives
a truant wife?"</p>

<p>"I was miserable," said the prostrate Julia.</p>

<p>"How few are otherwise," returned her mother,
"if all secrets were disclosed? Happiness
is a nonsensical word&mdash;a rock to shipwreck romantic
hopes. We may not command happiness,
but we <i>can</i> command external blessings. With
every luxury that reflected honour upon human
beings, what right had you and Clara to be
otherwise than content?"</p>

<p>"How cold&mdash;how cruel to speak so harshly!"
ejaculated Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>"Had you not rank?" continued Lady Wetheral&mdash;"had
you not a princely home&mdash;an
earl's coronet? Had you not all the world can
bestow, when you fled from your husband's protection?"</p>

<p>"I fled from treachery and from infamy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Infamy! Who dares report of infamy?"
Lady Wetheral started to her feet, and supported
herself by grasping the back of a chair.
"Has my daughter, Lady Ennismore, allowed
herself to become&mdash;? has the breath of suspicion
breathed upon a Wetheral!&mdash;has <i>one</i> suspicion
glanced upon you, Julia?"</p>

<p>"I have flown to my father, to avoid my own
reproach," cried Julia; "I care not for the world&mdash;I
have flown to escape the reproaches of my
own heart."</p>

<p>"Folly&mdash;madness!" observed her mother&mdash;"flown
from your heart! What heart had you
which was not wedded to your station&mdash;to the
eminence in life upon which you were called to
stand above your companions? Are you not
wedded to the title of Ennismore? Are you not
the proud wife of a British peer?&mdash;an earl's wife?
Is not your heart hid behind the folds of your
ermine, and buried in the magnificence of your
lot?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;it is not there!" cried Julia, clasping
her hands&mdash;"it is not there! My heart was
given to kindness. I would have loved him faithfully,
but I was banished from his presence&mdash;second
to his artful mother in his thoughts&mdash;betrayed
by the person I most trusted&mdash;proscribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
as the mistress of his house. Many women
would have resented the indignities I have borne&mdash;but
I have flown from the temptations which
surrounded me, and my father has given me
shelter. Oh! you have sacrificed me, but do
not upbraid me&mdash;I have done no wrong to any
one. Why should <i>you</i> look hardly upon me,
who promised me happiness, and have broken its
fulfilment? Poor Clara! how we have suffered
for our fault. My father warned me of my
wickedness!"</p>

<p>"Did <i>I</i> not warn you, Lady Ennismore?"
asked Lady Wetheral, with a raised complexion,
as she beheld, unmoved, poor Julia's suppliant
attitude. "Did <i>I</i> not say, I scorned a woman
who was mean enough to seek the world's upbraiding
by her conduct? You were the Countess
of Ennismore&mdash;your flight has brought down
obloquy upon the name. Who will believe the
statement of a runaway? Who will believe the
fugitive Lady Ennismore has been unaccompanied
in her flight? The voice of the world will be
loud in censure upon the step you have taken."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father, my father! save me from the
world&mdash;save me from reproaches like these!"
exclaimed Julia, rising from her prostrate attitude,
and endeavouring to quit the room; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
her mother caught her dress, and detained her.
There was something awful in the expression of
her countenance, as she addressed Lady Ennismore.</p>

<p>"If a mother sacrifices her time and endeavours
to form a child's happiness, has she not a
right to expect its completion? Did I not act
for you&mdash;think for you&mdash;and labour for you?
Did I not place you in affluence and grandeur?
Are you not the Countess of Ennismore? Tell
me, are you not Countess of Ennismore, the mistress
of princely Bedinfield?"</p>

<p>"I am the unfortunate and unhappy wife of
Lord Ennismore," answered Julia, "the nominal
mistress of Bedinfield, but the real proprietor of
only sorrow and degradation."</p>

<p>"Away with such folly!" cried Lady Wetheral,
with vehemence; "let me not hear such mad complaints,
such horrible madness! Have you not
all that is coveted by human beings?&mdash;state,
high rank, wealth, and influence? What does
your arrogant heart covet <i>now</i>? What do you
presume to wish, beyond the splendid lot you
have obtained?"</p>

<p>"Happiness&mdash;I ask for happiness! I ask for
my husband's heart&mdash;I ask for domestic peace,"
replied Julia, pressing her forehead with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
trembling hands. "I ask for the simple pleasures
of domestic peace. I will not accept grandeur
without them!"</p>

<p>"You have brought public remark upon the
name of Wetheral," resumed her mother, her
eyes darting fire. "You have betrayed the confidence
of your mother, who hoped to see her
daughter an envied creature! You have thrown
away the jewels of life, to grasp at shadows.
Happiness!&mdash;<i>who</i> is happy?&mdash;not those who are
born to stand apart in grandeur&mdash;not those upon
whom the eyes of the multitude gaze in admiration.
It may be a word bandied by the humble,
to balance the evils of poverty, and give a zest
to lowly destinies&mdash;but the great ones heed it
not. <i>They</i> live in a sphere set apart from
grovelling notions&mdash;they spurn the folly of romantic,
sickly fancy, to hold on their course like
meteors! I am a parent most miserable. I am
deprived of all I laboured to advance. My heart
was anchored upon the glorious destiny of three
children, who have betrayed their high calling&mdash;but
Bell has done the worst. A dukedom was
offered her!&mdash;a dukedom was tendered to her, I
say! and the puny coward struck it from her!&mdash;oh,
that hour to a mother's heart!..."</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral's vehemence overpowered her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
strength. The sudden and unaccountable appearance
of her daughter, without any previous
warning, almost led her to suppose a spirit from
the dead had risen to taunt her with her deep
disappointments. It seemed as if a spirit from
another world had sought her, to jeer and mock
at her misery as a defeated mother, and that
form assumed the likeness of her banished Julia.
What! had she heard the word "infamy"
spoken?&mdash;did she hear that Lady Ennismore had
flown from her husband? Was this to be added
to Clara's death, and Christobelle's ingratitude?
Was she indeed to endure this accumulated burthen
of crushed hopes?&mdash;to see <i>all</i> her long
years of anxious efforts destroyed, and behold
the very beings she had raised so high, turn to
rend her? What spirit could bend under such
fearful ingratitude, that possessed one spark of
<i>her</i> indomitable determinations?</p>

<p>A deep pause succeeded. Julia still listened,
with her face buried in her hands, and her dress
was yet in the grasp of her mother's hand, when
a cry from Mrs. Bevan startled her. Lady Ennismore
looked up in terror. She beheld her
incensed parent standing before her, in the attitude
of reproach, but her eyes were dull, and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
form had become rigid: contending passions
were warring with terrible violence in her heart.</p>

<p>It was a fearful and affecting scene to witness,
but it could not long last. Lady Ennismore's
terror at her unfortunate mother's state obliterated
for the moment her own sorrows, and she
flew to assist Mrs. Bevan in her cares. Sir John
Wetheral and Christobelle were instantly summoned,
and the Castle became a scene of alarm
and confusion. Mrs. Spottiswoode was again a
true-hearted and valuable friend in their affliction.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral sunk into a long illness. Her
strife of heart&mdash;the strife of a high and determined
spirit contending with bitter mortifications
in all those things which she had so fondly
cherished&mdash;had nearly proved fatal to her frame,
and she was long vibrating between life and
death. But her naturally good constitution, and
the unremitting attentions of her daughters, overcame
the attacks of a dangerous malady, and
gradually Lady Wetheral became again convalescent.
The body slowly acquired some portion
of renewed health, but the mind was fixed in
gloomy irritability. Nothing could exceed her
ladyship's unbearable tyranny to those gentle
beings who strove to soothe her long confinement.
The victims of her ambitious projects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
were now the objects of constant petty and vexatious
attacks. Christobelle had one near her
who could lure her disquiets into happy tranquillity&mdash;but
Lady Ennismore almost sunk
under their distressing influence.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral bore all his trials with the
resignation of a man who received good and evil
things from his Maker's hands, and accepted them
as means of evidencing his patience and resignation.
He endured his lady's most disagreeable
taunts with the fortitude belonging to his estimable
character: he only appeared to suffer
when those taunts were levelled at the heartbroken,
gentle Julia. Lady Wetheral's tyrannical
temper seemed irrecoverable even by the
operation of time, or gentle forbearance. Mrs.
Bevan remarked "that her lady's eyes and manner
were peculiarly vehement in their expression,
during her reproaches addressed to Lady Ennismore."
It <i>must</i> have been a powerful feeling which
could produce such a change of manner in one
whose whole existence had been devoted to the
exercise of self-command, and who had ever deprecated
the bad taste and uselessness of "scenes;"
it must have been an overwhelming feeling of
ambition trampled to the earth, which bore down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and so successful in its schemes.</p>

<p>Christobelle had the blessing of Sir John Spottiswoode's
society, to balance her many hours of
disquietude. She could turn to him for happiness,
when her spirit was sad, and, under his
soothings, her mother's harsh remarks were forgotten.
Every disagreeable feeling passed away
in the sunshine of his presence. She only bent,
in grateful acknowledgment, to the Being who
had committed her infancy to her father's care,
to receive his wise admonitions, and be cautioned
to renounce the fearful dictates of ambition.
Christobelle saw how it had lured its victims to
woe. She knew it had destroyed the happiness
of Julia&mdash;that it had aimed the death-blow to
Clara&mdash;that it had worked desolation upon her
mother. Every one who drank of the cup which
a reckless ambition presented to their lips had
tasted a deadly poison, which slowly and surely
produced desolation of heart. Christobelle felt
she had been spared. She had not been overwhelmed
by its cold precepts: she had received
strength to endure oppression, and had not bartered
peace of mind for the empty glare of
worldly distinction. Christobelle was indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
grateful, as she pondered these things in her
mind.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore was called to a less fortunate
destiny. Her spirits were broken by the continual
and ruthless observations which were showered
upon her by her irritable parent, under
the pressure of time unemployed, and the total
failure of resource. Lady Wetheral's mind turned
to the past, for materials to employ her weakened
energies; and the past could only give back
harassing recollections. Such recollections produced
a constant state of irritation, which was
hurtful to herself, and intolerable to those around
her. Wetheral Castle appeared the grave of
every hope, and the "<i>oubliette</i>" to rational, tranquil
comfort. The heart of Lady Ennismore was
depressed beyond recall, by continued and unsuccessful
efforts to appear cheerful under accumulated
suffering. It was impossible to give satisfaction
to an exacting and imperious mother.
She could only weep in privacy, and pray to be
"laid by Clara."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode was unwearied in her kind
visits during Lady Wetheral's illness. The Penelope
of former days was the same attached
friend at the present hour; and Lady Ennismore
felt how blessed was the possession of a gentle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
heart, which had clung to her through good and
evil report&mdash;which never exacted selfish sacrifices,
or shrunk from the task of enduring much,
to soften the distresses of an uncomplaining
spirit. Mrs. Spottiswoode bore the petulant
remarks of Lady Wetheral with patient good-humour.
If the "blood of the Wycherlys" rose
occasionally into her cheeks, and latent fires
sparkled in her eye, the door of her lips were
hermetically sealed, and she never resented the
offensive petulance of a defeated and angry man&#339;uvrer.
Her only desire aimed at warding off
for a few hours the painful observations which
must otherwise have been levelled at two unoffending
objects.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral did not object to receive Mrs.
Spottiswoode. However strongly her character
approximated to that of her aunt Pynsent in its
outline, her manners were less abrupt, and her
temper more yielding. Mrs. Spottiswoode had
also "crept in" so silently and regularly, that
a visit every other day was considered a thing of
course; and if Lady Wetheral had any thing
particularly disagreeable or offensive to say, she
contrived to say it to Mrs. Spottiswoode. Mrs.
Spottiswoode bore every thing with smiles: she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
suffering, the injured, and dependent Julia.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral confined herself entirely to her
apartments, and declined all society. She derived
no satisfaction from the visits of friends,
whom she was sure came on purpose to deride
her sorrows. She particularly commanded to be
denied to Mrs. Pynsent. She told Mrs. Spottiswoode
it was unpleasant to be restricted from
communion with her neighbours, but she must
be aware her aunt Pynsent was inadmissable
from her loud tone of voice, and uncouth way of
blurting out offensive remarks. Her aunt was
a misery in a sick room, and she only wondered
how Clara could endure it, to the exclusion of
the mother who had promoted her marriage, and
endured so much to effect it.</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral also confided to Mrs. Spottiswoode
her opinions upon Christobelle's folly.</p>

<p>"Your brother, Mrs. Spottiswoode, is a very
gentlemanly man, but a poor baronet is a sad
match for Bell&mdash;I will never lend myself to it.
I know Sir John allows him to visit here, and
Bell is engaged to him in some way or other, I
dare say. Perhaps they are waiting for my
death? Bell refused a dukedom, and is content
to accept a Worcestershire baronet! Can you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
believe any thing so degrading?&mdash;and waiting,
too, for her poor mother's death! This is very
dreadful! How can I look any of my neighbours
in the face? I am told Lord Farnborough is
going to marry Fanny Ponsonby: it serves Bell
quite right, and I hope she will feel it severely.
A pleasant sight it will be to see the Forfar
equipage dashing by, while Bell is only a poor
baronet's wife in a britzska. I cannot endure
such thoughts. Bevan, where are my salts?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Lady Wetheral, if my brother
makes Christobelle happy, and if he indulges her
with all the comforts of life, what more can a
human being require?"</p>

<p>Lady Wetheral shuddered.</p>

<p>"The comforts of life! Bread and cheese to
eat, and a stuff gown and straw bonnet to wear&mdash;is
this the vulgar and popular idea of existence?
You, Penelope, have married into the family,
and are justified in upholding it, but I will never
see Bell, if she can endure degradation! My
health is sacrificed to outraged feelings! Lady
Ennismore, if it is not too much trouble, will
you be so considerate as to move this cushion a
little higher. Your ladyship has had little
practice, I fancy, in the nursing department: it
never occurs to you how much I am suffering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Ennismore silently adjusted the cushion,
but the allusion to her banishment from her
lord's sick room, renewed the grief of her heart:
tears sprang to her patient, expressive eyes.
This could not be overlooked by Penelope Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>"Lady Wetheral, I demand, and insist upon
the necessity of Lady Ennismore's removal for a
few days to Lidham. I must not allow you all
to waste away in witnessing each other's depression.
Christobelle and Sir John will take Julia's
place, while I run away with my friend this very
morning. I shall not return to Lidham till you
are ready to accompany me, Julia."</p>

<p>There was "a Pynsent tone" in Mrs. Spottiswoode's
speech, which Lady Wetheral felt
unable to contend against: her ladyship detested
that <i>Hatton</i> expression of voice. She replied
languidly, with an injured and offended air,</p>

<p>"Pray do as you please, Mrs. Spottiswoode.
Every one has done, and, I suppose, <i>will</i> do, as
they please with me. I am too feeble to resist
violent resolutions. I beg to decline having any
one forced upon me. Lady Ennismore has renounced
control of any kind, and, of course, she
will continue to act as she thinks proper, without
consulting her mother. Sir John and Christobelle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
I suppose, will visit me, without being
'offered.' I conclude my family will relieve my
solitude voluntarily, though I am considered of
secondary importance. Bevan, where is my
pocket-handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"In your hand, my lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. I wish I was equally blind
to more distressing annoyances. I wish I could
lose sight as easily of other things."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode turned a resolutely deaf
ear to all covert attacks. It was imperative, in
her opinion, to withdraw Lady Ennismore to
Lidham, and the harsh conduct of Lady Wetheral
only riveted her resolution. Sir John
concurred in her views. He was aware his
daughter endured much, and he wished her to
be removed altogether from a scene so destructive
to her peace. It was impossible to hope
Julia could ever regain tranquillity, when the
wounds of her heart were torn open by daily
and hourly invective. Christobelle and himself
would attend the querulous invalid, in patient
hope that time would soften the asperity proceeding
from a diseased mind, but he saw the
absolute necessity of withdrawing Lady Ennismore
from her attendance. Sir John Wetheral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
hoped she would remain a long season in the society
and hospitality of Lidham.</p>

<p>Yet Julia quitted her father with great reluctance.
She knew her sister was happy, and
supported by the occasional visits of Sir John
Spottiswoode. Her heart was occupied by a
powerful attachment, and sorrow had not thrown
a mantle of gloom over <i>her</i> young visions yet.
Her affection was blessed by a father's approval,
and the smiles of rejoicing friends; yes, Christobelle
could contemplate her futurity fearlessly&mdash;but
who would, or could, pour balm upon her
father's solitary hours? His study was still a
sanctuary, but he carried into its precincts a disturbed
and heavy spirit. Julia could not bear
the idea of quitting her father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode smoothed every thought
which could ruffle her friend's equanimity, and
planed away all difficulties. She unburdened
her mind to the four friends who surrounded her,
as she hastily partook of sandwiches.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir John, I have achieved a scheme,
which will set my Julia's heart at rest, and
yours, too. I counsel you to keep the 'poor
Worcestershire baronet' at Wetheral, till happier
times arrive. Why should not he bear
some share of the evil, when the good is before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
him? and by his sparkling eyes, and intelligent
glances at Christobelle, I judge he is willing to
undertake the task. This is my advice, as far
as concerns <i>yourself</i>; now for my brother-in-law:
listen, young man, and be guided! I
counsel you to be gentle mannered, and prompt
in action, as I have been. <i>Creep in</i>, as I have
done; and bear all irritating remarks, as I have
borne them. Learn to be enduring, patient, and
silent, and I will undertake to promise you sufficient
success. Who undertakes to refute my
words?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode looked round at her auditors,
but there was no refutation. Sir John
Spottiswoode alone replied, and he only spoke
his eager wishes to assist in tranquillizing Lady
Wetheral's objections to his suit. He would
wait in patience and persevering attentions, to
attain that blessed reward of his labours, if it
was required, even for years.</p>

<p>"Six months will do, John, if you are politic.
Sir John Wetheral, pray lead Lady Ennismore
to my carriage, and I will follow, after a few
words in a corner with my brother."</p>

<p>Sir John led out his daughter, while Christobelle
clung to her sister's hand. She was going
to lose her for an indefinite period, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
should miss her gentle voice and affectionate
smile. Spottiswoode would be with her, and
she could not but own his society was a charm
to balance a thousand ills. Nevertheless, she
must miss Julia every hour. She would have
the satisfaction, however, of knowing how much
she would be prized by Mr. and Mrs. Spottiswoode.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode did not long detain her
friends. Her words were few, and decisive.</p>

<p>"John, that unhappy woman is as mad as a
March hare. I never can believe her sane,
therefore, I bear with her. Let her abuse you
and your friends; and allow her to speak whatever
she thinks of aunty Pynsent, and I am sure
you will become necessary to her. Her manners
are so completely changed, that I am confident
she is deranged, and it is no use quarrelling
with mad people."</p>

<p>"It is an extraordinary method of making
oneself acceptable, Penelope. I am not sure I
can endure to hear my friends abused, but I will
endeavour to be pleasing, and you may be sure I
shall 'creep in' after Christobelle. Once fairly
admitted into the invalid's room, you need not
fear my second dismissal."</p>

<p>"Very well, I have no more to say, then. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
upon her to remain at Lidham. She is enduring
too much for human nature to bear. Farewell."
Mrs. Spottiswoode then joined her friends.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral pressed Mrs. Spottiswoode's
hand, as he assisted her into the carriage.
"Accept," he said, "the grateful thanks
of a father for this kind and thoughtful step.
May <i>you</i> never be called to sorrows which
your warm heart is seeking to alleviate in your
friends!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode returned the pressure.</p>

<p>"I do not ask you to come to us very often,
because I know you cannot exist long from Julia;
but be sure you always bring good news with
you from Wetheral. God bless you all!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 3.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>


<p>Lady Ennismore recovered some degree of tranquillity
under the soothing influences of her
friends, who congregated round her at Lidham,
but her spirits never recovered their tone of elasticity.
She met the Pynsents with severe distress,
and struggled visibly for fortitude, as recollections
of the past crowded to memory; but
when that fearful interview was once effected,
Anna Maria's society was productive of much
good. Tom Pynsent was unchanged; he was
the same excellent and honourable creature: he
was an affectionate and valued husband; they
appeared to be, and were, the happiest couple
in the world. No wonder Anna Maria looked
younger and handsomer than ever. Her heart
was at rest. How warmly had her father spoken
of Tom Pynsent's good qualities. Alas! <i>she</i>
had preferred splendid misery, and was now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
reaping a harvest of woe. She would not, dared
not, think too deeply.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore could contemplate Mrs. Boscawen
with unmixed satisfaction. She was
changed in person, and improved in manner.
Mr. Boscawen was proud of his lady; and how
could he help it, since he was, in her eyes, the
best and handsomest of created beings? It must
be a new and delightful existence to the once
alarming, grim-looking, though excellent, Mr.
Boscawen.</p>

<p>The sight and sounds of those she loved was
of important benefit to Lady Ennismore. The
accents of affection, the voice of mirth, the forms
of her long banished friends gliding before her,
roused her dormant energies, and awakened her
to the joys of life. She paid short visits to
Hatton and Brierly, to see her nephews and
nieces; and, though her lips never uttered a
remark, Mrs. Spottiswoode fancied her more
languid and pale after her brief absence. Doubtless,
the "rural sports" at both places were too
powerful for her weakened frame and shattered
nerves.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore continued three months with
Mrs. Spottiswoode. Sir John Wetheral brought
a bulletin daily of his ladies' health, and each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
wrote despondingly upon the subject to
her sister. She regretted to say her poor Spottiswoode
failed in all his patient exertions to win
her mother's approbation. She was happy to
think there was no cause of complaint against
him of any serious nature. His crime consisted
in having stepped in between her poor mother's
ambition and a dukedom; and this would ever
be unpardonable in her eyes. Her mother was
relentless towards Spottiswoode. She would
not pronounce his name, or receive a message
from him. She only alluded to him as the "poor
baronet," or "the man whom Sir John upheld."
It was vain to hope against hope. Her mother's
dislike grew more powerful as her strength declined,
and it would end only in the grave. Her
mother received no one; she appeared to have
renounced society, and her movements were exclusively
confined to her own range of apartments.
Mrs. Daniel Higgins was admitted frequently,
because she had been the depository of
her lady's secrets in days of yore, and was now
a patient listener to her regrets; but, beyond
that, all was silent at Wetheral. Christobelle
considered her father in much better spirits.
He had become apparently reconciled to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
cheerful, more called forth, she thought, than
when her mother was the dominant spirit. It
might be that his mind was at rest concerning
his children; that he was no longer dreading
plots and systems, and was gratified by the constant
society of Spottiswoode, who was so attentive
and companionable to him. She could
not tell, but so it was. She was distressed to
think they were so happy together, when her
poor mother's situation was so cheerless, and her
health so visibly declining!</p>

<p>Such was the tenor of Christobelle's communications
to Lidham, and they renewed Lady
Ennismore's anxiety to return to Wetheral. She
longed to relieve Christobelle from some portion
of her fatigues; and, above all, her spirit flew
back to her father. She could never sufficiently
value his parental anxieties, or the protection he
was affording her sorrow. A father's presence
was a shield from every worldly blast; and the
perfect seclusion of Wetheral Castle suited best
with her present state. Lidham was almost too
gay, though she only met looks and words of
kindness and approbation. It was time that
Christobelle should also enjoy a period of happy
communion with Sir John Spottiswoode; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
that period could not arrive, unless some one
assumed the reins in her place, and bore the disagreeables
of the nursing department. Mrs.
Spottiswoode's good sense acquiesced entirely
in Lady Ennismore's reasonings.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, <i>you</i> are perfectly right,
and <i>I</i> am only perfectly sorry to lose you. I
anticipate much comfort in the present state of
things, however dismally Christobelle represents
them. You will all be happier at Wetheral,
and I shall see your face beaming with
smiles, in spite of Lady Wetheral's monastic
retirement. Don't look distressed, Julia; I am
going to explain myself."</p>

<p>"My mother has received an incurable wound,
Penelope!"</p>

<p>"I know that. Lady Wetheral has received
an incurable wound in her ambition, and that
has closed her hopes and pleasures on this side
the grave. She has no child to plan for&mdash;not
one now to sacrifice. All is ended which employed
her mind, and fed the craving passion of
her soul. Her resources are cut off, and she
will never more resume her position in society.
Is it not wisely ordered? If Lady Wetheral
recovered her health, would she not be scheming
for her grandchildren, and pouring her besetting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Julia, enough misery has been originated. Let
it end here. Let us not wish it otherwise."</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore could not refute her friend's
argument. Mrs. Spottiswoode continued.</p>

<p>"Wetheral Castle will never, perhaps, resume
its festive scenes, for there has been too much
of evil connected with their remembrance; but
you will enjoy profound peace of heart, and receive
your friends without alarm. If Lady Wetheral
remains secluded in her apartments, there
is no reason why the rest of the family should
not enjoy themselves: forgive me if I say it will
prove <i>true</i> enjoyment."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spottiswoode spoke truly. Wetheral
Castle did become a home of domestic peace,
because its restless mistress no longer wielded
the sceptre of power, to transform the elements
of good into the instruments of evil. Lady
Wetheral sunk into ill health and apathy, irrecoverable.
Her mind and body seemed stunned
into torpor, by two events which she had not
foreseen, and could not parry&mdash;the refusal of a
dukedom by Christobelle, and the flight of Lady
Ennismore from her home. These two events
were ever upon her thoughts, and in her speech,
because "she had particularly arranged each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
splendid match, and was doomed to be foiled
by her own children in their accomplishment.
She knew her energies were worn down, and
her strength exhausted. She could not walk
three steps from her sofa without fatigue, and
the least noise produced severe nervous attacks.
She was a pretty specimen of maternal cares!
She advised all parents to allow their headstrong
daughters to marry whoever would encumber
themselves with them; for marry they would,
and it was hopeless to endeavour to lead their
tastes in a proper channel. She expected Mrs.
Higgins would let <i>her</i> little girl grow up in insubordination,
and the child would most likely
marry a bricklayer, instead of looking up to a
man in a well established grocery-business. She
detested mean minds."</p>

<p>Lord Ennismore and his mother, the Dowager-countess,
appeared again at Bedinfield. Her
ladyship's point was gained. She had recovered
entire control over the destinies of Bedinfield,
freed from continual alarms, lest her son should
escape her powerful influence, and become infatuated
by the loveliness and yielding disposition
of his gentle wife. But she did not long
enjoy the fruits of her unnatural conduct. Ere
a year had elapsed after the separation recorded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Lord Ennismore sank into the family vault at
Bedinfield, unwept and unhonoured, save by
the generous-hearted creature whom he had not
the capacity to appreciate.</p>

<p>When Lady Ennismore received the information
of her unfortunate lord's decease, she wept
to think how desolate had been the existence of
a human being, born to become the tool and
victim of his mother's insatiable love of power;
and she wept to remember he had died without
the consolation of being watched over by a wife,
who would have acted honourably and faithfully
in her duties.</p>

<p>Sir John Wetheral also suffered. He felt a
conviction that his own want of firmness had
fostered his lady's ambitious turn of mind; and
he dwelt upon the melancholy idea that his own
hand had bestowed, however unwillingly&mdash;that
his consent had been extorted, however painful
to himself&mdash;to give a beloved child to the imbecile
Lord Ennismore. It was a thought he
never could banish from his memory, and it
pained him most when Julia's society became
his greatest comfort. It was, however, vain
to regret the past. Sir John's mild nature was
unequal to contend with the persevering system
adopted by his lady, and he could never comprehend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
efforts to forward her views upon the minds of
her children. The Gertrude of his early affections
was now severed from his companionship,
and he turned to Julia, to receive from her hands
the care and attention necessary to his future
comfort.</p>

<p>Lady Ennismore fully requited her parent's hope.
She sought no society beyond her own family, and
the little circle of friends who had ever valued
her affectionate heart. Mrs. Spottiswoode, the
friend and beloved companion&mdash;that solace to
earthly tribulations&mdash;that gift tendered to few&mdash;was
near her. Hatton was a home of affection,
and Brierly threw open its portals with triumph
at her approach. All had respected and honoured
the hapless wife, and all surrounded the released
widow in silent gratulation. Mrs. Pynsent publicly
declared "It was a deep trick of that
woman Ennismore, whom she never could endure;
and if the poor young Julia Wetheral
had not fallen into the hands of two she-Philistines,
she never would have married that sickly
little chap, whom the mother led about by the
nose. Some things which should be nameless
were already come to pass, and she hoped Old
Nick would fly away with all man&#339;uvring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
mothers. A certain lady was shorn of her
beams, who expected to command the world;
and after brandishing her arms, and catching all
the prime matches up, she was cut down into a
mighty small space, with an evil conscience to
chat with. If Lady Ennismore would be advised,
she should counsel her to change her
name and title, by marrying a comfortable
Shropshire lad. There were plenty unprovided
for."</p>

<p>But Lady Ennismore declined all thoughts of
marriage, and devoted herself to the comforts
of her parents. Colonel Neville wrote, at the
expiration of her mourning, and he laid claim
to her compassion, in consideration of the patience
and constancy which had accompanied
his involuntary and fervent attachment. He
had condemned himself to a perpetual banishment,
even from the country which she inhabited.
But now that the bar was withdrawn, the
hour of disclosure was arrived, and Julia must
have respected the love which consumed him.
She could bear witness that he had never
breathed an unhallowed sentiment, or endeavoured
to take advantage of her situation, during
their long and constant association in Florence.</p>

<p>Julia sighed as she read the declaration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Neville, but her heart renounced a second engagement.
"No," she wrote in reply to her
lover's epistle&mdash;"no, my heart has suffered too
much disquietude to enter upon fresh ties. I
feel a calmness and consolation in watching over
my father's comfort, and taking charge of my
stricken mother, which my married life denied
me. That portion of my existence was a period
of deep misery, and it has broken down my
hopes and my spirits. Be happy, Neville, with
a woman who has not been called to suffering,
and forget one who will never more trust in
man, or in herself. I will not give hope, for
you do not deserve to be treated lightly, and I
cannot now meet your wishes. May I soon hear
you have met with a woman deserving your
esteem, and that your days are devoted to her
happiness. My own days are consecrated to
the father whose counsel I would not heed, and
who has suffered so much through my obstinate
folly."</p>

<p>And what shall be said of Christobelle? Her
portion was not the cup of bitterness, though
her patience was severely tested. Lady Wetheral
became indifferent to all passing events
so gradually, and her mind dwelt so little upon
any thing unconnected with her own ease and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
immediate gratification, that Mrs. Daniel Higgins
adventured to touch lightly upon the subject,
during one of her visits.</p>

<p>"I am happy, my lady, to be hearing of Miss
Chrystal's likelihood, at last, to marry Sir John
Spottiswoode. Higgins thinks it a very pretty
match, and he has visited Alverton more than
once, and admires the place extremely. For
ever and a day!&mdash;to think of Miss Chrystal's
turn being come!"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it, Thompson, and I
don't care. The Worcestershire man shall never
enter <i>my</i> room, though he is quite good enough
for a young lady who refused a dukedom. If
Julia would attract the old Duke of Forfar,
now she is at liberty, I should still recover my
health; but I am laid on the shelf. No one
cares about my health. Lady Ennismore might
easily win his Grace; only, I dare say, she
would run away from him, as she did from Lord
Ennismore."</p>

<p>Christobelle married Sir John Spottiswoode
soon after Lady Wetheral's assurance to Mrs.
Higgins that she "did not care" about the affair,
and no one apprised her ladyship of the
actual solemnization. She never asked who was
the "Lady Spottiswoode" whom people talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
so much about, and always addressed her by the
title of Miss Wetheral.</p>

<p>Did Christobelle ever repent her refusal of a
dukedom, or experience a repentant feeling that
she had given her whole heart to the husband of
her choice? No. Life brings too many cares
to allow of perfect enjoyment upon earth, but
Christobelle never regretted the vows she paid
at the altar: she never regretted the hour when
she became the bride of Spottiswoode, and exchanged
Wetheral Castle for the tranquil groves
of Alverton.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
